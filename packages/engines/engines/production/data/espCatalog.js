/**
 * ESP reference data (Production P5).
 *
 * What is here and what is deliberately not:
 *
 *  - REFERENCE_STAGES are MODEL stages, built by
 *    espPump.referenceStageCurve from four named parameters (rate and
 *    head at best efficiency, the shutoff head ratio, peak efficiency).
 *    They are shapes for sizing exercises, grouped by the housing sizes
 *    the industry standardised on. They are NOT any manufacturer's
 *    pump, they carry no part numbers, and a real design enters the
 *    vendor's own curve points instead. The predecessor app shipped
 *    invented curves under real-sounding vendor model names, which is
 *    exactly what this file refuses to do.
 *  - CABLE_SIZES are copper conductor resistances from the standard AWG
 *    tables — a property of the metal, not a vendor's product. The
 *    ampacity column is left for the manufacturer: it belongs to the
 *    insulation system and the well temperature, so it is an input.
 *  - MOTOR_FRAMES are the common submersible motor voltage and power
 *    combinations, present so a sizing run has somewhere to start. A
 *    real design types the nameplate off the motor being run.

/**
 * Copper conductor resistance, ohms per 1000 ft at 77 degF (standard
 * AWG table values for stranded copper). Ampacity is intentionally
 * absent: it is a manufacturer and temperature number.
 *
 * The consequence, stated here so it is not discovered downstream:
 * `espMotorCable.selectCable` cannot check ampacity against a candidate
 * that carries no `ampacityA`, so run against THIS table every size
 * comes back `ampacityChecked: false` and the pick is made on voltage
 * drop alone. Supply `ampacityA` from the manufacturer's chart at the
 * conductor temperature to get the second half of the check.
 *
 * The field used to be called `ampacityOk` and used to read TRUE here,
 * which is the reverse of the truth: no check had run. Item 4 of the
 * owner's 4 September 2026 decisions renamed it, on the rule that a
 * quality signal which does not measure what its name says is worse
 * than no field at all.
