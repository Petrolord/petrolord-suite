// VOI Analyzer computation layer, extracted VERBATIM from the Suite's
// src/utils/voiCalculations.js in the EC0 extraction wave, 2026-09-08. The
// ONLY edit is the import: the Suite file took the canonical engine from
// '@/lib/decisionTree'; this copy takes it from './decisionTree.js' (the
// same file, vendored beside it). Percent inputs are what the Suite's form
// types (0 to 100); money is $MM. Gated by __tests__/economics.decision.test.js
// (the VOI parity cases in test-data/economics/goldens/decision_cases.json).
//
// VOI Analyzer computation layer. Since D3 the math delegates to the
// canonical decision-analysis engine (src/lib/decisionTree.js): EMV / EVPI
// come from the engine, per-indicator EMVs use bestActionEmv over the
// user-entered posteriors, and impliedPriors flags inputs whose indicator
// marginals and posteriors contradict the stated outcome priors (the user
// types those independently in this legacy input shape, so nothing forces
// them to be Bayes-consistent).
//
// EC4-0 (2026-09-14, owner decision): the Analyzer no longer reports a value
// of information built on numbers that contradict each other. Percent inputs
// that are not distributions are REFUSED with a DecisionTreeError naming the
// sum in percent: outcome chances, indicator chances, and each indicator's
// outcome chances. Inputs that are distributions but imply outcome chances
// other than the stated ones (impliedPriors inconsistent) keep the two cards
// that depend only on the stated priors (EMV without information and EVPI)
// and WITHHOLD the rest: emvWithInfo, voi and netVoi are null, the tree is
// null, `withheld` is true and the insight says why. Before this, such inputs
// produced full cards, including a gross VOI below zero or above EVPI, and an
// indicator whose outcome chances did not sum to 100 made the cards and the
// diagram disagree while the consistency check passed.
//
// EC4-8 and EC4-2 (2026-09-15, owner decisions): the percent tolerance
// comparison adds the engine's 1e-12 binary representation allowance, so
// three outcome chances typed 33.3333 (99.9999, exactly 1e-4 short in the
// typed decimals) are accepted while a sum off by more is still refused. Net
// VOI is rounded ONCE to card precision (2 decimal places, half away from
// zero) and that single rounded value feeds both the card and the verdict: a
// net VOI that rounds to 0.00 (|net| < 0.005) gets its own neutral sentence,
// and no card or insight ever prints "-0.00". Before, the verdict read the
// unrounded value, so a survey cost of 32.996 showed a 0.00 card under "Since
// this is positive" and 33.004 showed "-0.00" under "not justified".
//
// EC4-9 (2026-09-15, owner decision): once every typed percent input has
// passed validation, the indicator chances and each indicator's outcome
// chances are divided by their own sums before anything is computed from
// them. Validation admits sums within the tolerance of 100, and the Bayes
// inversion below multiplies two such sums into the diagram's "Signal
// received" branch: every chance typed 33.3333 made that node sum to
// 0.999998, and the strict chance node check refused a node the user never
// typed. The renormalised set feeds the cards AND the diagram, so the two
// stay one analysis. Nothing else is renormalised: the stated outcome chances
// are used as typed, the consistency check reads the typed entries, and a
// chance node typed directly in the Decision Tree Builder keeps the strict
// refusal.
//
// Economics E2 replaced the node/link "plot data" this used to return with a
// real decision tree. Nothing rendered those nodes (the panel was a "Chart
// removed" placeholder), and their link values were not a quantity: each was
// the running EMV total multiplied by an indicator probability. The tree
// below is built by the canonical builder and rolled back by the canonical
// engine, so the picture and the KPIs cannot disagree.
