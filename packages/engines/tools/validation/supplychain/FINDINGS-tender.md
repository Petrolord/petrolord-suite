# FINDINGS: tender (oracle_tender.py, Supply Chain SC2, procurement, tendering and contracting)

Golden: `test-data/supplychain/goldens/tender_cases.json`, 177 cases (88 of
them refusals, every refusal message pinned in full), written by
`tools/validation/supplychain/oracle_tender.py`. Gate:
`__tests__/supplychain.tender.test.js` (214 tests) calls the engine on every
golden, checks the published worked examples against their printed figures,
checks the planted fixture situations and runs property tests. Negative
control: `negcontrol_tender.sh` (63/63 engine plants red, 8/8 oracle plants
caught). Timing: `timing_tender.js` (table below). Fixtures:
`test-data/supplychain/ekene-tender/`, written by `make_tender_fixtures.py`.
Full engines suite on the branch: 228 suites, 17,545 tests passed (on the unknown-keys branch).

The oracle is STDLIB ONLY (python 3.12: `fractions`, `decimal`, `math`). It
reads no JavaScript and takes a different road on every route (table in its
docstring): money, scores, content percentages, the life-cycle net present
cost and the Monte Carlo accumulators in exact Fractions; its own ranking by
selection with the 12-digit tie key by Decimal ROUND_HALF_UP; mulberry32 in
unsigned 32-bit integers; the triangular inverse CDF from the CDF's
definition; the wellCost duration forms and the AFE rollup re-derived; the
partner split as 100 less the sum of interests; the ALB standard deviation by
exact variance and Decimal square root. Figures printed inside a message are
replayed in doubles in the order the engine states (left-to-right sums),
because a message prints the double the engine holds; every numeric field is
compared against the exact value. A limit the user types (a tolerance, a
band) is read by the oracle as the decimal it was typed as (0.8 is 4/5); the
engine compares doubles, and the two agree except within one unit in the
last place of the limit, which the boundary table states.

## Fixtures (synthetic, ours)

Two Ekene tenders (`test-data/supplychain/ekene-tender/README.md` lists the
planted situations): EK-11/WS/2027-01, coiled tubing cleanout and matrix acid
stimulation on Ekene-3 and Ekene-5 (6 bids; combined award at technical
weight 0.7, inside the para 5.50 cell b range 0.6 to 1.0 for a high-risk
contract under US$10 million), and EK-11/MS/2027-02, casing, gate valves,
cement, baryte and inspection (5 bids; lowest evaluated cost with a five-year
valve maintenance life-cycle cost). Bidders are codes named "(synthetic)".
Wells and depths follow `test-data/ekene-dynamic/field.json`.

## Published worked examples (goldens, printed figures beside)

| source | what it prints | exact (engine and oracle) | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| WB Guidance Figure IX | Company A weighted score 190 | 190 | agrees |
| WB Guidance Figures X to XII (technical 80%, cost 20%; E rejected as an ALB) | A 63.33 / 16.92 / 80.25; B 66.66 / 17.60 / 84.26; C 68.33 (Fig. X), 68.34 (Fig. XII) / 20.00 / 88.34; D 80.00 / 18.34 / 98.34; ranking D, C, B, A | A 63.3333 / 16.9231 / 80.2564; B 66.6667 / 17.6000 / 84.2667; C 68.3333 / 20 / 88.3333; D 80 / 18.3333 / 98.3333 | ranking agrees. Printed figures are truncated in places (79.16, 63.33, 80.25) and rounded up in others (18.34, 98.34, 68.34 in Fig. XII against 68.33 in Fig. X); each is within 0.01 of the exact figure and none is it. |
| WB Guidance Annex 2 (minimum quality threshold 80) | totals A 59, B 82, C 91; A rejected, C first | A 59, B 77, C 91; A and B below 80 | **Erratum in the Guidance**: B's printed criterion scores 12 + 11 + 54 sum to 77, not 82, so on its printed scores B also fails the threshold. The outcome the Guidance states (C first) is unchanged. |
| WB Guidance Annex 3 (technical 40%, financial 60%) | A 40 + 54.37 = 94.37; B 31.66 + 60 = 91.66; A wins | A 94.375; B 91.6667 | truncated to 2 decimals; ranking agrees |
| WB ALB Guidance Annex I Example 1 (16 bids, relative) | average 1,664,426; SD 315,975; limit 1,348,452; the lowest three bids in the risk zone | 1,664,426.375; population SD 315,974.537; limit 1,348,451.838; bids 1, 2, 3 flagged | agrees (rounded); the sample SD (326,337) would give 1,338,089, so the Guidance uses the population SD |
| WB ALB Guidance Annex I Example 2 (4 bids, absolute) | Bid 1 (85,862,863) more than 20% below the estimate 150,003,863 | Bid 1 42.76% below, flagged; Bid 2 23.0% below, also flagged | the Guidance names only the preferred lowest bid; Example 1 puts every bid past the limit in the zone, and the engine flags every such bid |
| Kiiver and Kodym (2015) Table 1 | 100, 67, 50 | 100, 66.6667, 50 | 67 is rounded. Their "under linear conditions it would receive 75 points" draws the line between A's 100 and C's 50; the engine's 'linear' method gives the highest bid 0 (the family their text describes), so B scores 50 on it. |
| Chen (2008) p. 409 | 50 x L / P: A 50, B 40, C 25; A declared invalid: B 50, C 31.25 (gap 15 to 18.75) | identical | the ranking paradox of relative price scores, exactly |

## Lead decisions (2026-09-26), applied in 20988b0

1. Omission pricing: `omissionRule` defaults to 'average' (WB SPD ITB 34.1,
   cited). 'highest' stays available; its reason, basis and the refusal
   message say the cited texts do not use it. The course teaches and grades
   the cited rule only.
2. Mean-deviation price scoring: DROPPED from the engine, oracle, goldens and
   tests (unsourced). `priceMethod` is 'lowest-ratio' or 'linear', both cited;
   'mean-deviation' is now refused (golden `rank-refuse-mean-deviation-dropped`).
3. s.14: the readings are stated verbatim in every s.14 reason and in
   `section14.readings`; `ncLeadBasis` stays a required input with no default.
   The course presents both readings side by side as an open question of the
   Act, and any graded field states its basis.
4. P-labels follow lib/conventions/percentile.js; the contractTypes basis
   states that for a cost P90 is the LOW cost and P10 the HIGH cost.
5. The 2010 Schedule only, stated with its date in every Nigerian content
   target source and basis ("Act No. 2, commenced 22 April 2010 ... as
   enacted in 2010 (later Board targets are not included)").

## Decisions and refinements of the lead's scope (as first reported)

1. **Omission pricing: the current texts say AVERAGE; the lead's scope said
   HIGHEST.** WB SPD ITB 34.1 (Works Sep 2025, Goods Feb 2025) prices a
   missing item at "the average price of the item or component quoted by
   substantially responsive Bidders", else the Employer's best estimate. No
   current text read uses the highest price. The engine has no default:
   `omissionRule` is 'average' (cited) or 'highest' (a stated alternative,
   labelled as an option the cited texts do not use). The materials fixture is built so
   the rule decides the lowest evaluated cost (average: MS4; highest: MS2).
   Lead decision taken: default 'average'; 'highest' kept, labelled.
2. **Which bids price an omission:** the other bids still substantially
   responsive at that point (bids rejected at the commercial stage and bids
   beyond the maximum completion time are removed first). A bid never prices
   its own omission.
3. **Arithmetic correction:** discrepancy when |quantity x unit rate - quoted
   amount| > tolerance, default 0.005 (half a cent; an engine convention, not
   a legal figure). ITB 35.1(c), words against figures, is not computed and
   is taught as a concept.
4. **Schedule adjustment base:** the SPD gives a rate per week beyond the
   minimum period without saying of what; the engine applies it to the
   corrected price less the unconditional discount and says so in the reason.
5. **Commercial scoring methods:** 'lowest-ratio' is the World Bank's (SPD
   formula; Reg Annex X 3.9; Guidance Figure XI). 'linear' (100 x (Cmax - C)
   / (Cmax - Cmin), all 100 when every price is equal) is the family Kiiver
   and Kodym describe. **'mean-deviation' (max(0, 100 x (1 - |C - Cmean| /
   Cmean))) has no published formula I could read**: Kiiver and Kodym and
   Chen describe average-price methods and warn against them, neither prints
   a formula, and the survey that does was not accessible. The formula is
   ours. Lead decision taken: dropped.
6. **Technical score:** 'relative' is the SPD's T/Thigh x 100 (the Guidance's
   comparative scoring); 'absolute' uses the percentage as scored. The
   technical percentage is sum of weight x score / maxScore with weights
   summing to 100 (refused otherwise, to 1e-9), so Annex 2's points and
   Figure IX's 0 to 4 scale go through the same function.
7. **Pass mark:** a bid passes at or above it (Guidance Annex 2 "scoring below
   this threshold will be rejected"; PPA s.51(2) "at or above the threshold").
   Only passing bids have their commercial envelope opened (WB Reg 6.29; PPA
   s.48(4), (5), s.51(2)); the gate checks `evaluateTender` never reads a
   failed bid's prices.
8. **Ties:** equal to 12 significant digits; tie-break lower evaluated cost,
   then earlier receipt, then bidder id (the lead's rule; no text read states
   one), printed on every row it decides (`tieBrokenBy`).
9. **s.14 of the NOGICD Act, three readings stated.** (a) "within 1 % of each
   other at commercial stage": the group is every bid with 100 x (C - Cmin)
   <= 1 x Cmin; any two bids in it are then within 1% of each other measured
   on the lower of the two. (b) "its closest competitor": the next-highest
   Nigerian content in the group. (c) "at least 5% higher": points or
   relative is not stated in the Act, so the engine has no default
   (`ncLeadBasis` 'points' or 'relative'). The materials fixture is built so
   the reading decides the award (points: MS4 stands, lead 4.54 points;
   relative: MS2 is selected, 7.96% higher). A shared highest content means
   no single bid leads and the lowest stands. s.14 applies only at the
   commercial stage of a lowest-evaluated-cost award; with a combined award
   the engine refuses and says to state content as a rated criterion.
   Lead decision: confirm (a) and (b), and which reading of (c) the course
   presents first (no NCDMB text read settles it). Lead decision taken:
   both readings side by side, basis stated on every graded field.
10. **s.16** protects an indigenous company with capacity from exclusion
    solely on price within 10 percent (100 x (C - Cmin) <= 10 x Cmin,
    inclusive); it never selects a bid. "Indigenous" and "capacity" are
    caller flags.
11. **Nigerian content measure:** content = 100 x Nigerian / total in the
    Schedule line's unit; another unit is refused naming the unit required.
    The Act has no rule for adding man-hours to tonnes: overall content is
    100 x sum Nigerian / sum total when all items share one unit, else the
    weighted mean of item contents with the bid's stated weights (the
    fixture uses each bid's spend per item). An item meets its minimum at or
    above it.
12. **The Schedule transcribed:** 45 lines, three sections. Omitted on
    purpose: lines printed with two units ("Petro physical Interpretation
    Services 75% Volume/Man-hour", "Pollution Control 90% Man-hour/Spend") and
    the gazetted text's own duplicates ("Pollution Control" twice, 45% Spend
    and 90% Man-hour/Spend; "Drilling rigs (Land)" twice, 70% both;
    "Equipment brokerage services" twice, 75% both). This is the 2010 Act's
    Schedule; s.11(2) lets the Board set a level for an unlisted item, and no
    later Board target was read, so such a target enters as a user-stated
    target with its source.
13. **Contract types:** the plan is the modes unless `plan` is given; an
    overrun is an iteration whose contractor cost exceeds the planned cost;
    companyPays + contractorAbsorbs = expectedOverrun exactly (lump sum: 0 to
    the company; cost plus 12%: 1.12 of it; day rate in between). A margin of
    exactly 0 is not a loss. With a wellCost programme, days = the programme's
    productive days (one `evaluateProgram` call) x (1 + NPT fraction), which
    is wellCost's own stretch rule.
14. **Percentile labels on a cost:** lib/conventions/percentile.js defines P90
    as "a 90% probability the actual quantity meets or exceeds this value",
    so for a COST the engine's P90 is the LOW cost (10th percentile) and P10
    the high cost, the reverse of the habit of many cost engineers. The engine
    follows the Suite convention and prints the definition
    (`percentileDefinition`). Lead decision taken: keep, state it in the
    basis, teach the reversal.
15. **Should-cost** is built entirely by the imported engines
    (`drilling/wellCost.js` evaluateProgram and afeCosts, contingency
    included; `economics/afe.js` calculatePartnerCosts for the net share). Its
    screening band is a stated input. The World Bank's own test is
    `abnormallyLow` (cited above); the engine's reason says a potential ALB is
    clarified with the bidder and never rejected automatically.
16. **Not implemented, taught as concept only:** domestic preference (WB Reg
    5.52: 15% goods, 7.5% works, Bank-financed international competitive
    procurement; PPA s.34(4) leaves Nigerian margins to Bureau regulations,
    not read), words against figures, the Board's approval steps (NOGICD s.17
    to s.24 and the US$1,000,000 threshold), the 1% Nigerian Content
    Development Fund deduction (s.104), BAFO and negotiations, lots.

evaluateProgram every iteration: 7.6 s at 20,000.) A course panel is
comfortable at 20,000 iterations and 100 bids of 100 lines.

## Foundation findings repair (2026-09-26, branch fix/tender-foundation-findings)

The SC2 course foundation found four wording and consistency defects; all
repaired before lessons, with no award or graded value changing (all 141
earlier goldens keep every non-message value; 16 change message text only).

1. Counts agree with their units: weeks ("1 week", "2 weeks") in every
   schedule reason, basis and exclusion, and percentage points in the s.14
   lead. The gate scans every golden output for "1 weeks", "1 percentage
   points", "1 bids", "1 prices", "1 iterations" and "1 years".
2. The uncited omission option reads "the 'highest' option, which the cited
   texts do not use" (it read as an "X, not Y" contrastive); the refusal says
   "an option the cited texts do not use". The gate scans every output for
   ", not " and for em and en dashes.
3. The s.14 reason when the runner-up has no Nigerian content states the 5%
   test once ("30% against 0% (LOW), a runner-up with no Nigerian content, at
   least 5% higher, so ...").
4. Shared highest content (and the runner-up) are decided on the engine's
   12-significant-digit tie key, as every other ranking in tender.js: 65 and
   65.00000000000001 share the highest content, so no single bid leads
   (golden `s14-shared-highest-at-12-digits`).

New goldens: `s14-shared-highest-at-12-digits`, `s14-lead-1-percentage-point`,
`ec-one-week-late`, `ec-one-week-beyond-minimum`. New negative-control plants:
exact-equality shared highest, week count without agreement, the zero
runner-up reason repeating itself, the highest option worded as a
contrastive; the two plants whose targets moved were re-aimed and re-run red.
Negative control on this branch: 58/58 engine plants red, 7/7 oracle plants
caught.

## Unknown input keys and the triangle wording (2026-09-26, branch fix/tender-unknown-keys)

Every public function now refuses an input key it does not read, at every
level it reads, so a misspelt optional key is never dropped silently (before
this, `lifecycle` in place of `lifeCycle` removed the life-cycle cost without
a word). The accepted keys are published as `ACCEPTED_KEYS` (one shape per
function); the walk checks an object's own keys in their order, then its
children in the listed order. A key whose value is undefined counts as
absent. The message names the key, its path and the accepted keys:

- `lifecycle is not an accepted key; the accepted keys at the top level are bids, omissionRule, bestEstimates, schedule, lifeCycle, tolerance`
- `duration.program[0].durationHrs is not an accepted key; the accepted keys of duration.program[0] are id, kind, label, ...`

Levels covered: top-level options; bids (per function); bill lines;
deviations; mandatory entries; criteria (id, label, weight, maxScore); the
schedule and life-cycle objects; triangles { min, mode, max } for days,
nptFrac and daily cost; the { program, nptFrac } duration; wellCost activities
and cost items; partners { name, working_interest }; the band; lumpSum,
dayRate, reimbursable and plan; content items and each bid's content data;
`nigerianContent` in evaluateTender. Keys that are ids are checked against the
ids: a bid's scores against the criterion ids, a bid's content items and
weights against the item ids, and bestEstimates against the items some bid
omits (in evaluateTender, against every bid; only the opened bids' omissions
reach the commercial stage). Accepted for display on every bid: `name`; on
criteria, activities and cost items: `label`.

The triangle refusals now share one wording for duration days,
duration.nptFrac and dailyCost, each with its exact condition and the figures:
`must be at or above 0; got x`, `must be a number or a triangular
distribution { min, mode, max } of finite numbers`, `.min must be at or above
0; got x`, `must have min <= mode <= max; got min a, mode b, max c`.

No award or value moves: all 145 earlier goldens keep every value, and only
the two duration-triangle refusal messages change text. The Ekene fixtures
pass whole (with their bid names). New goldens: 32 (31 refusals, among them
an unknown-key case for every function and nested ones at each level, plus
`ws-tender-best-estimate-kept-when-priced`). New negative-control plants:
unknown keys ignored everywhere, ignored inside lists, id-keyed objects
unchecked, a misspelt `lifecycle` accepted, the triangle refusal without its
figures, and the oracle's key check off. All go red.

## Open questions for the lead

1. Later NCDMB targets: the engine carries the 2010 Schedule only; any
   Board-revised target must be read and cited first.
