# Production Operations module — status

Plan of record: `docs/scope/Production-ROADMAP.md` (owner-approved
2026-08-27). This file tracks execution.

## P0 — Hygiene + honest catalog (COMPLETE 2026-08-27)

Everything below shipped on `feat/production-p0`.

**Deleted (1,522 LOC of dead/mock code, all verified unimported):**
- Production Uptime Tracker: page + `components/uptimetracker` (7
  files) + `uptimeTrackerCalculations.js`. Unrouted stale copy-paste of
  the surveillance dashboard.
- Production Anomaly Detector: `return null` page + three byte-identical
  null-stub components.
- Wellbore Flow Simulator (owner §6.3): page + `components/wellboreflow`
  + `wellboreFlowCalculations.js` + `wellboreFlowExport.js`. The
  "transient simulation" was a Math.random pressure walk. Route
  redirects to Nodal Analysis Studio.
- Artificial Lift Designer's three design tabs (`ESPDesign`,
  `GasLiftDesign`, `RodPumpDesign`): ESP TDH omitted net lift (staging
  ~10x wrong), invented gas-lift gradient, rod code neither Mills nor
  API RP 11L ("7/8" parsed as 7.8 in). The app is screening-only until
  the P4–P6 studios; pre-P0 saves carry their design inputs through
  untouched (`legacyDesignInputs`) for studio import.
- FNH's Deliverables tab: all four PDF exports were hardcoded fiction
  (12.75" line whatever you sized, canned pigging verdicts); the tabs
  hold private state so it could not see a real result.

**Routes:**
- Gated with `ProtectedAppRoute`: Nodal's three aliases (appId
  `nodal-analysis-engine`), `artificial-lift-designer`,
  `facility-network-hydraulics`. Was 1 of 5 gated; now every surviving
  production app is gated.
- Redirect to the hub until their rebuild phase: surveillance dashboard
  (both slug aliases, P2), flow-assurance-monitor (P10),
  network-diagram-pro (P11). Page code kept for phase salvage; lazy
  imports removed.
- `production-forecasting` → DCA Studio. `wellbore-flow-simulator` →
  Nodal.
- **FNH un-hijacked**: `apps/facilities/facility-network-hydraulics`
  served FacilityLayoutMapper, leaving 1,024 LOC of real hydraulics
  (Beggs & Brill flow-pattern map, Swamee-Jain, Colebrook-White,
  Barlow/ASME B31) unreachable. Now serves the real page, gated.

**Delisting (owner §6.4):** Network Diagram Pro's $199 override removed
from `pricingModels.js`; `applicationRoutes.js` entry removed;
`SupabaseAuthContext.allApps` trimmed of retired ids (and now carries
`nodal-analysis-engine` + `facility-network-hydraulics`, which were
missing).

**Database (both migrations applied 2026-08-27, logged in
MIGRATIONS.md):**
- `20260827210000_p0_production_orphan_tables.sql` — repo DDL for the
  four Horizons-era tables + RLS enforcement. Security fix:
  `wellbore_flow_projects` had RLS DISABLED live (policy unenforced;
  all rows readable/writable by any authenticated user). Rows intact.
- `20260827220000_p0_production_honest_catalog.sql` — archived the 4
  misadvertising Active tiles + 31 Coming Soon stubs. Post-state:
  Production 3 Active (nodal-analysis-engine, artificial-lift-designer,
  well-schematic-designer redirect) / 36 Archived. Live now (hub is
  DB-driven); the frontend upload waits for P12 per owner §6.6.

**Chart standard:** FNH LineSizing's two charts moved to white
chartTheme + 40px ChartLogo, animations off; Unsplash backdrop removed.
ALD's only charts lived in the deleted design tabs.

**Verification:** full Suite jest 306 suites / 3755 passed;
`npm run build` green at every commit.

## Next: P1 — production data spine

`po_*` org-scoped tables (daily ledger on the VRR importer pattern,
well tests, deferments, allocation factors) + CSV importer +
wellsRegistry linkage. See ROADMAP §5.

## Gotchas for later phases

- The retired apps' tables (`wellbore_flow_projects`,
  `flow_assurance_projects`, `production_surveillance_projects`) stay
  read-protected until the owner-gated post-P12 drop decision.
- Old ALD saves may contain `gasLiftInputs`/`espInputs`/`rodPumpInputs`
  in `design_data`; P4–P6 studios should offer to import them.
- `utils/anomalyDetection.js` and `hooks/usePhase5State.js` sound like
  the deleted anomaly detector but belong to a different (multi-well
  portfolio) tree; they were deliberately left alone.
- Salvage for P11: `components/networkdiagram` (editor) +
  `components/facilitynetworkhydraulics` (segment math). Salvage for
  P10: nothing in `components/flowassurance` (fictional equations);
  build on Fluid Studio EOS.
