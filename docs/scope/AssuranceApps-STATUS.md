# Assurance & Compliance module — status

Plan of record: `docs/scope/Assurance-ROADMAP.md`.
Wave: **AS1 (foundations), BUILT 2026-09-16**, migrations held.

This file replaces a document that carried the same name and described
the Economics E4 apps. That content now lives at
`docs/scope/ProjectManagementAfeReportAutopilot-STATUS.md`. The Assurance
module had no status document at all before this one.

## 1. Where the module actually stands

Assurance is the only Suite module that was never rebuilt. Geoscience
(G0-G8), Reservoir (R0-R5), Drilling, Production, Facilities (F0-F12),
Economics (E0-E5) and Midstream & Downstream (DS0-DS10) all got
programmes. This one is still in its Horizons-generated state.

| App | Route | Persists | State after AS1 | Wave |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Risk Register | `apps/assurance/risk-register` | `risk_register` (+ snapshots) | **Active.** Real, honest errors | AS2 |
| Risk Heatmap | redirect into the register | via the register | **Active** | AS2 |
| Regulatory Compliance | `apps/assurance/regulatory-compliance/*` | 3 services | **Active.** Real, honest errors | AS3 |
| ISO Compliance | `apps/assurance/iso-compliance/*` | nothing | **Demoted to Coming Soon.** `@/data/isoComplianceData` in `useState` | AS8 |
| Document Control | `apps/assurance/document-control/*` | `documents`, mock fallback | Coming Soon | AS4 |
| Peer Review Manager | `apps/assurance/peer-review-manager/*` | `peer_reviews`, mock fallback | Coming Soon | AS5 |
| Management of Change | `apps/assurance/management-of-change/*` | nothing | Coming Soon | AS6 |
| Quality Assurance Plan | `apps/assurance/qa-plan/*` | nothing | Coming Soon | AS7 |
| Audit & Findings Manager | not built | - | New app | AS10 |

Tests: **none**, under any assurance path. Engine: **none**; there is no
`engines/assurance` in petrolord-engines. Both are why the two NextGen
assurance courses are deferred to AS12.

## 2. AS1, built 2026-09-16

Four migrations and two penetration tests. **Nothing is applied.**
Production applies are owner-run.

### 2.1 The catalogue was wrong in both directions

`master_apps` held 33 Assurance rows, 14 `Active` with
`is_functional = true`. **Ten of those fourteen had no page, no route and
no code at all**: Audit Trail Manager, Safety Audit Manager,
Environmental Compliance, Monte Carlo Analyzer, Decision Tree Analyzer,
Charge/Seal/Trap Risk, Exploration Risk Analyzer, Prospect Ranking Tool,
Data Privacy Manager and Security Analytics. A customer could buy all
ten, and module price is computed from this catalogue
(`pricing_config.module_pricing`).

At the same time five apps that are built, routed and entitlement-gated
sat behind a Coming Soon badge, so nobody could buy the ones that work.

`20260916100000_as1_assurance_honest_catalog.sql` archives the ten
phantoms and the fourteen zero-code Coming Soon stubs, demotes ISO
Compliance (real code, zero persistence), and leaves the five built apps
at Coming Soon for their own waves to promote.

Post-state, verified on a scratch rebuild: **3 Active, 6 Coming Soon,
24 Archived**. The three Active tiles are the three apps that are real
and persist honestly.

### 2.2 The assurance schema had RLS disabled

Read live from `pg_class.relrowsecurity` and
`information_schema.role_table_grants`: **twenty-three Assurance tables
had RLS disabled with `SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE` granted
to both `anon` and `authenticated`**.

The four parent registers had RLS. Their children did not, and the
children are where the content lives: every risk comment, every MOC
approval decision, every document revision and its `file_url`, every
audit trail row. `anon` is the role behind the publishable key that
ships in the production bundle.

The tables are empty today. That is the only reason this is a defect and
not an incident, and it stops being true the moment the module is used.

`20260916101000_as1_assurance_rls.sql` revokes `anon` on all
twenty-three plus the nine already-protected parents, enables RLS, and
scopes each child through its parent's `org_id` via `public.my_org_id()`.

### 2.3 The schema existed only in the live database

No migration in this repo created any Assurance table, so the module
could not be rebuilt from source and its RLS posture was unauditable
without reading production.
`20260916099000_as1_assurance_schema_backfill.sql` backfills 33 tables,
101 constraints and 5 indexes, on the `rb_*` precedent.

Two things it records rather than fixes:

- `risk_register.risk_score` is a **stored generated column**,
  `(likelihood * impact)`, so the score tracks edits. `rating` beside it
  is an ordinary text column written by whichever client touched the row
  last, so the band can disagree with the score it describes. AS2 gives
  rating one computed authority.
- `documents`, `risks` and `actions` are unprefixed names predating the
  product-prefix convention. Not renamed; nothing new joins them.

### 2.4 The same hole is platform-wide

Re-run without the Assurance filter: **121 public tables have RLS
disabled and full CRUD granted to `anon`**. Almost all are empty legacy
tables. These are not:

- `organization_apps` (9 rows), the org entitlement table that
  `SupabaseAuthContext` reads to decide who may open which app. Anyone
  holding the publishable key could insert a row granting any
  organization any app. That is a monetization bypass.
- `pricing_config` (6 rows), the server-authoritative module pricing,
  writable the same way.
- `quotes` (6 rows), real customer quotes with `organization_id` and
  `user_id`.
- `api_keys`, `access_credentials`, `studio_access_tokens`: empty, named
  for secrets, referenced by no code in the repo.

`20260916103000_commerce_and_credential_rls.sql` closes those, shaped by
what actually reads each table so nothing breaks. It is a separate file
because it is not Assurance work and should be reviewed and applied on
its own terms. **`organization_apps` and `quotes` are shared tables and
need a second engineer's review before apply.**

The remaining ~90 empty legacy tables are named, not swept. Enabling RLS
on a table another module is quietly using breaks that module.

## 3. How AS1 was verified

No production write was made. Everything below ran on a scratch
PostgreSQL 15 instance.

1. The schema backfill rebuilt all 33 tables from nothing but itself
   plus `organizations`, `users`, `auth.users` and the two RLS helpers.
2. The catalogue and RLS migrations applied on top; re-applying all
   three on the rebuilt database is a clean no-op.
3. `tools/validation/assurance/rls-pentest-as1.sql`, seven behavioural
   blocks, all green: `anon` denied on read and on write; org isolation
   on a child of `risk_register` (own 1, other 0, update 0, delete 0);
   a cross-tenant child insert refused by the `WITH CHECK` half; the
   two-level `doc_workflows` path scoped correctly, with each org seeing
   only its own revision `file_url`; MOC approvals scoped; a
   cross-org `risk_links` row invisible to both ends.
4. `tools/validation/assurance/rls-pentest-commerce.sql`, eight blocks,
   all green, including the three client reads that must keep working.
5. **Negative controls were run for both**, because a gate that cannot
   fail proves nothing. Against the tables in their production posture:
   `anon` read both organizations' private risk comments and
   successfully inserted a row; `anon` read every entitlement and every
   quote, rewrote `pricing_config`, and granted an organization an app.

Two checks could **not** be completed. Impersonating the `anon` role
against production (`set local role anon`) and reading `pg_policies`
bodies were blocked by the auto-mode classifier as production reads. The
findings rest on the catalogue evidence, which is conclusive at the
schema level, and on the scratch reproduction.

## 4. Open

- **All four migrations are unapplied.** Ordered apply script:
  `tools/validation/assurance/as1-apply.sh`. Owner-run.
- The commerce migration needs a second engineer (shared tables).
- Five owner questions in `Assurance-ROADMAP.md` §7. AS1 proceeded on
  the recommendation in each case per the standing autonomous directive;
  each decision taken is recorded in the migration headers.
- `purchased_apps` is **inserted from the browser** by
  `src/utils/paymentVerificationLogic.js`. Recorded, not fixed.
- The ~90 remaining RLS-off legacy tables.
- AS2 onward: the apps themselves. The first rule of the programme is
  that no service in this module may return invented rows.
