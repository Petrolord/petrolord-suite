/**
 * Plunger lift (Production P7).
 *
 * A plunger is a free piston. The well is shut in until the casing has
 * built enough pressure to push the plunger, with a slug of liquid on
 * top of it, from the bottom of the tubing to surface. The well then
 * flows until it can no longer carry its liquid, the plunger falls
 * back, and the cycle repeats. It is the cheapest form of artificial
 * lift there is, and it works only when the well makes enough gas per
 * barrel to do that work.
 *
 * WHAT IS PHYSICS HERE AND WHAT IS OPERATING PRACTICE. The division
 * matters, because plunger lift is a field with a lot of rules of
 * thumb and this module is careful not to dress any of them up.
 *
 *   Physics, computed:
 *     - the pressure needed to lift the plunger and its slug, which is
 *       a static force balance and nothing more
 *     - the gas volume that has to expand to move them, from the real
 *       gas law over the swept tubing volume
 *     - the gas-liquid ratio that follows from those two, which is the
 *       honest feasibility number
 *     - the cycle arithmetic, once the velocities are known
 *
 *   Operating practice, INPUTS with stated typical ranges:
 *     - plunger rise and fall velocities
 *     - slug and plunger friction
 *     - afterflow and shut-in times
 *     - the screening rule of thumb, which is offered as a labelled
 *       cross-check and never as the answer
 *
 * The well-known screening heuristic -- roughly 400 scf of gas per
 * barrel per 1,000 ft of depth -- is included as
 * `ruleOfThumbGlr` because operators use it and comparing against it
 * is informative. It is NOT how this module decides feasibility. The
 * required gas-liquid ratio is computed from the work the gas actually
 * has to do, and the two are reported side by side.
 *
 * Field units: depth ft, pressure psia, length ft, area in2 and ft2,
 * volume bbl and scf, rate Mscf/d and bbl/d, velocity ft/min, time min.
