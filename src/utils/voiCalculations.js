// VOI Analyzer computation layer. Since D3 the math delegates to the
// canonical decision-analysis engine (src/lib/decisionTree.js): EMV / EVPI
// come from the engine, per-indicator EMVs use bestActionEmv over the
// user-entered posteriors, and impliedPriors flags inputs whose indicator
// marginals and posteriors contradict the stated outcome priors (the user
// types those independently in this legacy input shape, so nothing forces
// them to be Bayes-consistent).
//
// Economics E2 replaced the node/link "plot data" this used to return with a
// real decision tree. Nothing rendered those nodes (the panel was a "Chart
// removed" placeholder), and their link values were not a quantity: each was
// the running EMV total multiplied by an indicator probability. The tree
// below is built by the canonical builder and rolled back by the canonical
// engine, so the picture and the KPIs cannot disagree.

/**
 * Turn the legacy VOI input shape into the signal likelihoods the canonical
 * tree builder wants.
 *
 * Users type P(indicator) and P(outcome | indicator); the builder wants
 * P(indicator | outcome). Bayes inverts one into the other:
 *
 *   P(s | o) = P(o | s) * P(s) / P(o)
 *
 * This is exact and it round-trips: rolling back the built tree reproduces
 * the indicator chances and posteriors the user actually entered, whether or
 * not those are Bayes-consistent with the stated priors. The consistency
 * check stays a separate warning rather than something this quietly repairs.
 * An outcome with a zero prior cannot be conditioned on, so its column is
 * left at zero.
