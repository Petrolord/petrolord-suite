//
// CONVENTIONS (deliberate, documented D1):
// - Discounting is MID-YEAR (t + 0.5): screening convention, treats cash
//   as received evenly through the year. The EPE engine discounts
//   YEAR-END with a real-vs-nominal basis choice. The two engines will
//   not produce identical NPVs for the same case; that is a convention
//   difference, not a bug.
// - PSC cost recovery carries unrecovered costs forward across years
//   (same semantics as epe-engine applyPSC).
// - Taxable income deducts CAPEX via straight-line depreciation over
//   `capexDepreciationYears` (default 1 = immediate expensing, the
//   historical behavior). Cash outflow is always in-year regardless.
//   Depreciation scheduled beyond the project horizon is not deducted.

 * (FINDINGS S3). The stream is consumed in exactly the order the old gates
 * substituted for Math.random, so every previously published seeded value is
 * unchanged.
 *
 * THE KEYS ARE PLAIN PERCENTILES OF NPV. `p10` is the 10th percentile, the
 * LOW NPV; `p90` is the 90th, the HIGH NPV. Under the Suite's exceedance
 * convention (src/lib/percentileConventions.js) the low case is labelled P90
 * and reads `p10`. The keys are kept for existing callers; every screen must
 * map them through the convention rather than printing the key as a label.
 *
 * Also repaired: every uncertainty at zero makes all NPVs equal, which used
 * to divide by a zero bin width and throw (S4); now every iteration lands in
 * the first bin. Fewer than 50 iterations used to leave the S-curve empty
 * because the downsample step was zero (S5).
 *
 * EC3-7 (owner decision 2026-09-15): ONE factor per uncertain variable per
 * iteration, applied to every year. `reserves` scales oil and gas volume in
 * every year AND the variable operating cost that volume carries; `price`
 * scales oil and gas price in every year; `capex` scales every capex entry.
 * Each factor is uniform on 1 plus or minus its range, drawn in the order
 * reserves, price, capex, and a falsy range draws nothing. The run used to
 * draw every year separately, so "reserves 20 percent low" was twenty
 * independent draws that averaged each other out and the NPV spread came out
 * far narrower than the belief it was meant to describe; and variable opex
 * never moved. A range outside 0 to 1 is refused by name.
 *
 * EC3-6: the S-curve is 51 points at probability 0, 2, ..., 100 percent,
 * each read with the same quantile rule as the cards, so it starts at the
 * smallest NPV, ends at the largest, and its 10 / 50 / 90 heights are the
