// Client-side screening model for fiscal regime design: sliding-scale
// royalty, R-factor profit splits, cost recovery with carryforward, CIT/RRT.
//
// This is a regime SANDBOX, not a second fiscal truth. It exists to
// compare the shape of regimes against each other; full Nigerian fiscal
// math lives in the EPE engine
// (supabase/functions/_shared/epe-engine.ts), which stays the module's
// single source of truth. Where this model and the canonical engines
// overlap, they must agree, and that is now gated by tests.
//
// D1 (docs/scope/Economics-ROADMAP.md): IRR was a bisection solver (since
// EC2-5, 2026-09-15, it follows the screening engine's contract in
// ./irrContract.js, see calculateIRRResult), the tax base is the contractor profit share (costs
// are compensated via cost recovery; the old opex/2 halving is gone), and
// the RRT capital uplift is a regime parameter (tax.rrtUpliftPct, default
// 20). Since EC2-6 (2026-09-15) that uplift sizes a ONE-TIME uplifted cost
// pool for the RRT, capex times (1 + uplift), drawn down against the RRT base
// until it is exhausted; see calculateCashFlowForRegime.
//
// EC2-3 (2026-09-15): the capex sweep runs on an integer step count, eight
// points 0.8, 0.9, ..., 1.5 exactly (CAPEX_SWEEP_MULTIPLIERS). It used to
// accumulate 0.1 in floating point and stop at 1.4 while its axis and the
// resilience verdict said 1.5.
//
// E1 (2026-08-29) fixed two defects that survived D1, both found by
// checking the ledger's mass balance against the canonical PSC semantics
// in npvCalculations.js and epe-engine applyPSC:
//
//  1. COST OIL WAS NEVER PAID TO ANYONE. Recovered cost was subtracted
//     from profit oil, and then dropped. It was not credited to the
//     contractor and not counted to the government, so contractor take
//     plus government take came to less than revenue minus costs by
//     exactly the cost recovered. On a normal case that is hundreds of
//     millions of dollars a year evaporating out of the comparison the
//     whole app exists to make. Cost oil is now credited to the
//     contractor, which is what a production sharing contract does and
//     what both canonical engines already did.
//
//  2. OPEX WAS NEVER RECOVERABLE. The cost pool was seeded with capex
//     and nothing was ever added to it, so operating cost was charged
//     as cash but could never be recovered. Both canonical engines put
//     the full cost outflow into the recoverable pool. This one now
//     does too, with the unrecovered balance carried forward.
//
// CONVENTION: discounting here is YEAR-END (t = 1, 2, ...), matching the
// EPE engine. The screening engine in npvCalculations.js discounts
// MID-YEAR, so for identical cash flows its NPV is larger by a factor of
// (1 + r)^0.5. That relation is gated by a test rather than left as a
// surprise.
