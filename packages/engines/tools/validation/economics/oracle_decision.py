  EMV rollback      a terminal is worth its payoff (the mean of a
                    distribution summary); a chance node is worth the
                    probability weighted sum of (child value minus branch
                    cost); a decision node is worth the MAX of (child value
                    minus branch cost) over its branches, the rational
                    risk-neutral actor. Ties at a decision are REPORTED
                    (EC4-1, owner decision 2026-09-15) at TWO precisions:
                    every branch whose value is within 1e-9 * max(1, |best|)
                    of the best is tied on value, and every branch whose
                    value ROUNDS to the same card as the best (2 decimal
                    places, half away from zero, zero unsigned) is tied at
                    card precision. Each set says whether it is indifferent,
                    the two are measured independently (an exact tie can
                    straddle a rounding boundary and print two cards), and
                    the single index the path marking needs is the FIRST
                    listed of the value-tied ones. Guidance a reader sees
                    quotes the card-precision set, so the words agree with
                    the numbers printed beside them. Every branch reachable by taking
                    the best decision at every decision node is on the
                    optimal path. Probabilities at a chance node must be a
                    distribution: each in [0, 1], summing to 1 within 1e-6,
                    an inclusive tolerance on the numbers as typed (EC4-8,
                    owner decision 2026-09-15: three branches typed 0.333333
                    sum to 0.999999, exactly on the edge, and are accepted).
                    Accepted probabilities are used as typed and are never
                    renormalised. Anything further off is REFUSED, not
                    repaired.

  money             a cost or a payoff that is OMITTED is 0. One that is
                    PRESENT must be a finite number, or a string holding one:
                    a blank entry, a null, a non-numeric value, a NaN or an
                    infinity is REFUSED, naming what carries it and the
                    field, and a negative cost is refused because a receipt
                    is a payoff (EC4-4, owner decision 2026-09-15).

  EVPI              E over outcomes of the best (payoff minus cost) given
                    the outcome, minus the best expected (payoff minus cost)
                    under the priors. Written directly in that closed form.

  EVII              signal marginals P(s) = sum_o P(o) P(s|o) and posteriors
                    P(o|s) = P(o) P(s|o) / P(s) through Bayes; the value with
                    information is sum_s P(s) max_a E[payoff minus cost | s];
                    EVII is that minus the prior best. Priors, and each
                    likelihood column (over signals, for a fixed outcome),
                    must sum to 1 within the same inclusive 1e-6 or the case
                    is refused. A signal that cannot occur (P(s) = 0)
                    contributes nothing; its posterior is reported as the
                    prior, the engine's documented fallback.
                    Identities the oracle asserts on every case:
                    0 <= EVII <= EVPI; a signal with identical likelihood
                    rows for every outcome is worth 0; a perfect signal is
                    worth exactly EVPI.

  implied priors    P_implied(o) = sum_i P(i) P(o|i) from independently
                    typed indicator marginals and posteriors; consistent when
                    every delta against the stated prior is within half a
                    percent (0.005), the engine's documented threshold,
                    inclusive. (EC4-0 gave the engine a 1e-12 representation
                    allowance so a delta of exactly 0.005 in the typed
                    decimals agrees with this; finding D1 is resolved.)

  information tree  the classic single-stage tree, BUILT HERE from the
                    method statement (decision: acquire or not; acquire leads
                    to a chance node over signals at their marginals, each to
                    a decision over actions, each to a chance node over
                    outcomes at the posterior, each to a terminal at the
                    payoff) and rolled back by the oracle's own rollback. The
                    golden carries every node and branch value, and the
                    closed-form identities root = max(evWithInfo minus cost,
                    emvPrior) are asserted before anything is emitted.

  VOI Analyzer      the legacy input shape: percent priors, percent
                    indicator marginals, percent posteriors typed
                    independently. As repaired in EC4-0 (owner decision
                    2026-09-14): every percent input must be a distribution
                    or the case is REFUSED, each chance in [0, 100] and each
                    sum within 1e-4 percent points of 100: the outcome
                    chances, the indicator chances, and each indicator's
                    outcome chances (an outcome with no entry counts as 0).
                    EMV without information is the better of acting (sum
                    prior payoff minus decision cost) and not acting (0);
                    EVPI from the closed form. When the implied priors are
                    NOT consistent with the stated ones, those two are
                    reported and everything that depends on the indicator
                    entries is WITHHELD: no EMV with information, no VOI, no
                    net VOI, no verdict, no tree. Otherwise, per indicator,
                    the best action under the entered posteriors; EMV with
                    information before cost is the marginal weighted sum;
                    VOI is the difference; net VOI subtracts the information
                    cost. Every card is the value rounded to 2 decimal
                    places, half away from zero, and a card that rounds to
                    zero reads 0.00 whatever the sign (never -0.00). EC4-2,
                    owner decision 2026-09-15: net VOI is rounded ONCE and the
                    verdict reads that rounded card: 'acquire' when it is
                    above 0.00, 'reject' when below, 'neutral' when it is
                    0.00, that is whenever |net VOI| < 0.005. The diagram is the
                    information tree above with the ENTERED marginals and
                    posteriors. EC4-9, owner decision 2026-09-15: once every
                    typed input has passed, the indicator chances, and each
                    indicator's outcome chances, are each divided by their
                    own sum, and those renormalised sets are the marginals
                    and posteriors for the cards and the diagram alike (the
                    stated outcome chances stay as typed, and the consistency
                    check reads the typed entries). Sums that are exactly 100
                    are unchanged by this (the Bayes inversion the engine performs
                    round-trips exactly, which is a theorem, not an
                    implementation detail).

  arithmetic        every probability and payoff is a fractions.Fraction, so
                    each golden number is EXACT before it is emitted as a
                    float. The engine works in binary floating point on the
                    float images of the same inputs; the jest gate allows
                    1e-9 absolute on unrounded quantities and half a cent on
                    the VOI Analyzer's two-decimal KPI strings.

Money is USD millions ($MM) throughout, the unit of the Suite's Decision
Tree Builder and VOI Analyzer. Percent inputs to the VOI Analyzer are 0 to
100, exactly what its form types.
