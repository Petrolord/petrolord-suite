# Petrophysics Studio — STATUS

Plan of record: docs/scope/PetrophysicsStudio-PLAN.md (**approved as
drafted 2026-07-13**, all five §8 questions confirmed). Roadmap slot:
Geoscience-ROADMAP.md Phase G2 — the flagship. Slug
`petrophysics-studio` (tile ships at G2.6 with the route, per the
deploy lesson).

## Phase status

| Phase | Status | Landed |
|---|---|---|
| G2.0 oracle + goldens | **DONE** | PR #59 — independent stdlib Python oracle, analytic 201-sample type well (exact Archie round-trip anchors), byte-identical goldens, README numeric contract |
| G2.1 engines | **DONE** | PR #59 — engine/{vsh,porosity,rw,sw,netpay}.js ported from the proven legacy core + hardened; 32 jest tests vs goldens at 1e-12 |
| G2.2 schema + pentest | **DONE** | migration 20260713220000 **applied live 2026-07-13**; pentest blocks 8–9 executed, 6/6 green |
| G2.3 workstation core | **DONE** | this branch — workstation on the shared shell, canvas TrackViewer (zoom/pan/crosshair, zone bands, tops), draft-and-apply ParameterPanel, ZoneManager w/ live oracle-verified summaries, engine/pipeline.js, /dev/petrophysics-studio harness seeded with the analytic type well; e2e asserts the ORACLE numbers off the UI (SAND A net 18.0 m, SAND B 2.5 m) |
| G2.4 crossplots + facies + Pickett | pending | white-chartTheme windows, polygon tagging, Pickett fit → params |
| G2.5 write-back + batch | pending | publish curves (provenance contract) + zones; multi-well batch |
| G2.6 digitizer + close-out | pending | raster import wizard; delete 5 superseded apps + routes; tile Active + route in one PR |

## Key facts

- Registry-native: all well/curve/top data via `src/lib/wellsRegistry.js`
  (G1 tables). Computed curves publish as ordinary `geo_wells_logs`
  rows with `provenance.computed` — no schema change.
- Validation: dual implementation vs `tools/validation/petrophysics/`
  (independence rule — the oracle is never written from the legacy or
  engine JS). Numeric contract in test-data/petrophysics/README.md.
- Bateman-Konen Rwe→Rw is deliberately OUT of v1 (no verifiable open
  source for the coefficients); the SP chain is the documented
  quicklook approximation.
- The legacy `src/utils/petrophysicsCalculations.js` stays untouched
  until its consumers die at G2.6 (PetrophysicsEstimator still uses it).
