/**
 * Liquid loading in gas wells (Production P7).
 *
 * A gas well carries its own liquid up as entrained droplets. Below
 * some rate the gas can no longer do that, droplets fall back, liquid
 * accumulates in the tubing, and the growing column kills the well.
 * The rate at which that starts is the single most useful number in
 * gas well surveillance, and it is what this module computes.
 *
 * TURNER'S EQUATION IS DERIVED HERE, NOT QUOTED. The whole thing falls
 * out of two statements about the largest droplet the gas can hold up:
 *
 *   1. At terminal velocity, drag balances weight less buoyancy.
 *        Cd (pi d^2 / 4) rho_g v^2 / (2 gc) = (pi d^3 / 6)(rho_L - rho_g)
 *
 *   2. A droplet bigger than a critical Weber number shatters, so the
 *      largest STABLE droplet is set by
 *        We = rho_g v^2 d / (sigma gc) = We_crit
 *
 * Eliminating d between them gives
 *
 *        v = [ 40 gc^2 sigma (rho_L - rho_g) / (Cd rho_g^2) ]^(1/4)
 *
 * and with Cd = 0.44, We_crit = 30, gc = 32.174 and sigma in dyne/cm
 * the bracket collapses to 1.5936, which IS the 1.593 every gas-well
 * text prints. The gates check that. Deriving it rather than
 * remembering it means the drag coefficient and the critical Weber
 * number are visible inputs a user can argue with, instead of being
 * buried inside a constant.
 *
 * TURNER AND COLEMAN ARE THE SAME EQUATION. Turner et al. (1969) found
 * their field data sat about 20 percent above the theoretical velocity
 * and applied that adjustment. Coleman et al. (1991), working on wells
 * below about 1,000 psi wellhead pressure, found the UNADJUSTED
 * equation fitted better. So the two differ by one factor, and this
 * module treats them that way rather than as two correlations.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT INVENTED HERE. Interfacial tension and liquid density
 * are inputs. Water and condensate differ by a factor of three in
 * tension and are not interchangeable, and neither is a function of
 * anything this module knows. Turner's own values are offered as
 * labelled starting points, not as correlations.
 *
 * Field units: sigma dyne/cm, densities lb/ft3, velocity ft/s,
 * pressure psia, temperature degR, area ft2, rate Mscf/d.
 *
 * ONE DOOR CONVENTION FOR TEMPERATURE: degR AT EVERY BOUNDARY.
 *
 * Every temperature this module accepts or returns is absolute, in
 * degrees Rankine, and every parameter that carries one is named with a
 * trailing `R` so the unit is visible at the call site: `tempR`,
 * `T_STANDARD_R`, `stationTempR`. Nothing here takes degF and nothing
 * here converts, so a Fahrenheit reading handed to any function in this
 * file is silently wrong by 459.67 rather than refused.
 *
 * The one place in this domain that takes degF at its door is
 * `gasProperties.js`, whose `tF` and `tempAtDepthF` arguments are
 * Fahrenheit by name and which converts with its own `toRankine` before
 * any gas law sees them. That module's header says so. Callers crossing
 * between the two convert at the boundary; nothing in this file does it
 * for them.

 * above the critical rate at the wellhead and loading at the shoe,
 * which is exactly where liquid actually starts to collect. So the
 * controlling point is the one with the largest critical rate, and
 * this returns the profile and names it rather than evaluating at the
 * wellhead and hoping.
 *
 * `stations` is [{ depthFt, pPsia, tempR, z, idIn }] from the caller's

 * of Turner and Coleman applies is decided by pressure, and pressure is
 * exactly the thing that changes down a string: the same well can be

 * shoe. Choosing one correlation from the wellhead and applying it at

 * Which correlation the well's conditions call for.

 * Coleman's data set was low-pressure wells; Turner's adjustment came
 * from higher-pressure ones. This reports the guidance rather than
 * silently switching, because which one an operator trusts is theirs
 * to decide and the difference is only 20 percent.
 *
 * TWO THINGS THE MESSAGES USED TO GET WRONG.
 *
 * The branch is a STRICT comparison against 1000 psia and the reason
 * then printed the pressure it branched on, rounded whole, so a well at
 * 999.62 psia read "At 1000 psia wellhead this well sits inside the
 * low-pressure range" under a branch that only takes wells BELOW 1000.
 * The reader is shown a number that argues against the recommendation
 * attached to it, and the recommendation is worth 20 percent of every
 * critical rate computed after it. One decimal narrows that collision
 * by ten rather than removing it: a pressure inside 0.05 psi of the
 * limit still prints as the limit.
 *
 * `station` is the label for the pressure being handed in. It defaults
 * to `wellhead`, which is what the messages always said, but this
 * function takes ANY station's pressure and callers do hand it others,
 * so the word is the caller's to set rather than a fact asserted about
 * a number this function cannot see the origin of.
 *
 * AND THE THING THAT FIX ITSELF GOT WRONG. `Math.round` swallows
 * anything: it turned `undefined` into NaN and the string '900' into
 * 900, so a caller handing this function rubbish got a confident
 * correlation and never knew. `toFixed` is a method on Number, so the
 * same three inputs THREW instead. The format was display-only in
 * intent and was not display-only in effect, because nothing had
 * validated what reached the formatter. The pressure is checked before
 * it is formatted now, and a pressure that cannot be read is said to be
 * unreadable rather than printed as "NaN psia" or crashing the caller.
 * What this function returns for a good pressure is untouched.
 *
 * AND WHAT THAT GUARD STILL LEFT. Stopping the crash left the silence,
 * and the silence was the older and larger problem. `belowLimit` and
 * `correlation` are computed BEFORE the finiteness check, and the
 * unreadable branch returned that correlation anyway with the whole
 * disclaimer living in `reason`, which is prose. So the correlation a
 * caller got for an unreadable pressure depended on WHICH KIND of
 * unreadable it was, because `NaN < 1000` is false and `null < 1000` is
 * true:
 *
 *     recommendCorrelation(NaN)        -> 'turner'
 *     recommendCorrelation(null)       -> 'coleman'
 *     recommendCorrelation(undefined)  -> 'turner'
 *     recommendCorrelation('900')      -> 'coleman'
 *
 * Turner IS Coleman plus twenty percent, so a caller that read
 * `.correlation` and ignored `.reason`, which is what callers do,
 * silently applied or declined a twenty percent adjustment to every
 * critical rate in the study according to whether a missing pressure
 * arrived as a null or as a NaN. A refusal a caller cannot test for is
 * not a refusal, it is a comment.
 *
 * WHAT `ok` MEANS. `ok` is true when the pressure was a finite number
 * and the correlation named is a reading of this well's conditions.
 * `ok` is false when no pressure could be read, and then NOTHING else
 * on the result is a recommendation: `correlation` and `adjustment`
 * carry only where the comparison against the Coleman limit happened to
 * land on an unreadable value, and they are returned solely so that
 * callers written against the older shape keep working. A caller
 * seeing `ok: false` should ask for a numeric pressure in psia, or
 * choose the correlation itself, rather than use the one named here.
 *
 * `correlation` deliberately keeps its historical value and its type on
 * a false `ok`. Returning null there would break callers that read the
 * field directly, and that remains the owner's call; the gates pin both
 * halves so a later change to it cannot pass unnoticed.
 *
 * `code` is `unreadablePressure` on the refusal, so the refusal is
 * machine-readable as well as testable.

 * Critical rate goes as roughly the square root of pressure, so it is a
 * different number at every station in the well, and the whole point of
 * `loadingProfile` is that the CONTROLLING station is usually the shoe
 * rather than the wellhead. A sizing row recorded its correlation and
 * its adjustment but not the conditions behind them, so two runs of this
 * function at two stations produced two tables that looked
 * interchangeable and were not. `stationDepthFt`, `stationPressurePsia`
 * and `stationTempR` travel on every row, refusal rows included, so a
 * table can be read months later without the call that produced it.
 * `stationDepthFt` is the caller's label for the station and is null
 * when the caller did not give one; the pressure and the temperature are
 * the ones the row was actually computed at.
 *
 * `tempR` is degR at the door, per the module header.
