/**
 * Nodal analysis: inflow, tubing outflow, and the operating point where
 * the two meet (Production, extracted from the Suite's Nodal Analysis
 * Studio NA1/NA2/NA3 layer).
 *
 * THE IDEA. A well is two systems bolted together at a node. Below the
 * node the reservoir pushes: the more it flows the lower its flowing
 * bottomhole pressure, so inflow falls monotonically with rate. Above
 * the node the tubing resists: at low rate the column is heavy and
 * gravity dominates, at high rate friction dominates, so the outflow
 * requirement is J-shaped. The well produces where the two curves
 * cross, and NOWHERE ELSE. Everything in this module exists to draw one
 * of those two curves or to find that crossing.
 *
 * WHY THE CROSSING IS NOT A LOOKUP. The J-shape means there can be two
 * crossings. Only the right-hand one is a well that stays put: there,
 * the outflow requirement rises faster with rate than the inflow falls,
 * so a rate perturbation is pushed back. On the left branch the same
 * perturbation runs away, which is heading. A solver that returns "the
 * intersection" without asking which branch it is on will happily
 * report a rate the well cannot hold. So `solveNodeCore` returns EVERY
 * crossing, each with its stability, and the reported operating point
 * is the rightmost stable one.
 *
 * WHAT IS INJECTED, AND WHY. `solveNodeCore` takes the two curves as
 * FUNCTIONS. It does not know what made them. That is deliberate and it
 * is the same discipline `networkSolve` uses for branch relations: it
 * means the solver is checkable without judgement (hand it two curves
 * whose crossing is known in closed form and the answer is arithmetic),
 * and it means a consumer with a validated multiphase traverse of its
 * own -- the Suite marches Beggs-Brill, Hagedorn-Brown, Gray or
 * Fancher-Brown through a real PVT model -- can hand that in rather
 * than this module inventing a gradient. Only the DRY GAS outflow is
 * built here, because Cullender & Smith needs nothing but a z-factor
 * and is therefore honestly self-contained.
 *
 * The z-factor is injected for the same reason. `nodalGasZ` (Sutton +
 * Wichert-Aziz + Dranchuk-Abou-Kassem, from ./gasProperties.js) is the
 * default and is what the goldens are cut against, but a consumer whose
 * whole PVT stack is built on a different correlation must be able to
 * stay on it rather than have this module quietly disagree with the
 * rest of that consumer's numbers by a per-cent of z.
 *
 * UNITS. Field units throughout, as everywhere else in engines/production.
 * They are not converted internally and they are not optional:
 *
 *   pressure          psia            (never psig, never gauge)
 *   oil / liquid rate stb/d
 *   gas rate          Mscf/d, EXCEPT cullenderSmithBhp which takes
 *                     MMscf/d because the published F-squared group is
 *                     written that way
 *   depth             ft (mdFt measured, tvdFt true vertical)
 *   temperature       degF at the interface, degR inside the gas maths
 *   diameter          in
 *   productivity index stb/d/psi
 *
 * REFUSALS. Every entry point returns a NaN-free refusal (an empty
 * curve, a null operating point, a status, a warnings list) rather than
 * a page of NaN, because an inflow that did not calibrate has an
 * absolute open flow of NaN and every rate comparison downstream
 * against NaN is false: the caller sails past its own guards.
 *
 * VALIDATION NOTE. Gated against tools/validation/production/oracle_nodal.py
 * through test-data/production/goldens/nodal_cases.json. The oracle is
 * written from the published method statements, not from this file:
 *
 *   - where this module inverts an IPR by a Brent root find on the
 *     forward relation, the oracle uses the CLOSED-FORM inverse (the
 *     quadratic root of the Vogel ratio, the square root of the
 *     Fetkovich pressure-squared form, the quadratic root of Jones);
 *   - where this module marches Cullender & Smith as the published
 *     two-half-step trapezoid with a Simpson refinement, the oracle
 *     integrates the SAME defining integral as an ODE in depth by
 *     classical RK4 to step convergence, and the test additionally
 *     checks that the pressure this module returns satisfies the
 *     defining equation of the method rather than merely matching
 *     another implementation of it;
 *   - where this module finds crossings by scanning a forty-point grid
 *     and refining with Brent, the oracle scans a four-thousand-point
 *     grid and bisects, and classifies stability from a central
 *     difference five hundred times finer.
 *
 * Two discretizations of one physics agreeing is evidence. A transcription
 * agreeing with its source is not.

 *
 * ON THE STEP COUNT, WHICH IS NOT A COSMETIC CHOICE. Cullender and
 * Smith's two-station construction rests on I(p) being close to linear
 * over the whole column. That holds for a static or gently flowing gas
 * well and the published examples are all of that kind. It stops
 * holding when the friction group F^2 becomes comparable to the gravity
 * term, because I then bends sharply, and the two-station Simpson has
 * nothing to bend with. The independent oracle for this module
 * integrates the SAME defining integral to step convergence, and the
 * gap it exposes is not small: on an 8000 ft, 2.441 in string at
 * 9 MMscf/d the two-station answer is 1.3 psi low, and by 13 MMscf/d it
 * is 11.6 psi low, which moves the nodal operating point of that well
 * by about half a per cent of rate. Marching the same construction over
 * more sub-intervals removes it, and the error falls roughly with the
 * square of the count: on that same well at 13.3 MMscf/d the two-station
 * answer is 11.6 psi low, 16 stations is 0.26 psi low, 64 is 0.016 psi
 * low and 256 is 0.001 psi low, which is the converged integral. The
 * cost is a handful more z-factor evaluations. The default stays at 2
 * so that this module reproduces the published method as published, and
 * every consumer solving a real gas well at rate should raise it.
