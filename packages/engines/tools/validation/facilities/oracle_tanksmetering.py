"""Independent oracle for engines/facilities/storageTank.js and
engines/facilities/metering.js.

WHAT EACH ROUTE CHECKS, AND WHAT IT CANNOT. The honest answer is not
the same for all of them, so each group says its own:

 - `capacity`: the tank volume computed entirely in SI, in metres and
   cubic metres, and converted to barrels through 0.158987294928 m3.
   This checks the ASSEMBLY: the cross section, the height, and the cap
   on the fill. IT DOES NOT CHECK THE BARREL, and saying otherwise
   would be the kind of claim this wave exists to remove: the SI value
   of a barrel is 42 * 231 * 25.4^3 by definition, so it is the module's
   own packaging carried through exact conversions rather than a second
   opinion on it. That a barrel is 42 gallons and not 55 is pinned by a
   LITERAL in the suite, because the capacity test used to assert only
   that the module agreed with itself and 55 gallons was invisible.

 - `shell`: the API 650 one-foot method re-derived in SI (rho g H D
   over 2 S) so the 2.6 field constant is CHECKED rather than repeated.
   It cannot check the ONE FOOT itself: that offset is recovered from
   the engine numerically and pinned by a literal in the suite instead,
   because a two-foot method planted in this file and the module
   together used to leave the suite green.

 - `movement`: liquid movement venting through the same SI path, which
   checks the assembly and the high-volatility doubling. The barrel
   inside it is definitional, exactly as in `capacity`.

 - `thermal`: the proportional thermal rate and the governing-case
   predicate. A transcription of a stated engine choice, and it says
   so; the value of this route is the OVERLAP with `movement` in
   `normalVenting` and the governing-case label.

 - `fireDuty`: the wetted-area heat input bands, TRANSCRIBED. An
   earlier draft of this route carried the constants into SI and back,
   which cancels exactly and checked nothing; the oracle-only control
   battery caught it and it is gone. The real check is
   `fireBandEdges`: the RATIO ACROSS EACH BAND EDGE. Four power laws
   that must join up at 200, 1000 and 2800 ft2 cannot be moved one at a
   time, so the continuity ratios pin all eight constants against each
   other. This oracle produces NO VENT CAPACITY: the module withholds
   it, because the API 2000 air equivalence relation is not in this
   repository.

 - `evaporative`: the standing and working losses in SI, with the
   vapour density from the SI GAS CONSTANT and a molar mass in kg/mol.
   That part is a real check on the module's 10.731 psia ft3 per lbmol
   per R: the residual is about 5e-5, which is the rounding in 10.731,
   and an oracle-only change to the SI gas constant goes red. It does
   NOT check the empirical 0.053 or the shape of the expansion factor.
   The 0.053 is carried here per pascal per metre rather than per psia
   per foot, but be clear what that is worth: the conversion cancels
   against the pressure and the height, so it is presentation and not a
   check. What pins 0.053, and the 365 days, is a recovery from the
   engine compared with a LITERAL in the suite.

 - `orifice`: the orifice mass flow computed entirely in SI (kg/s from
   Pa and kg/m3) against the module's field-unit form, so the 32.174,
   144 and 0.0361273 packagings are checked. Genuinely independent.

 - `sizing`: the plate bore for a target flow found by bisection on
   the SI flow route, so the module's own bisection is checked against
   a different arithmetic rather than against itself.

 - `cd`: the Reader-Harris/Gallagher coefficient evaluated in
   ARBITRARY-PRECISION DECIMAL with the terms grouped differently.
   This checks the assembly and the floating-point arithmetic. IT DOES
   NOT CHECK THE PUBLISHED COEFFICIENTS: they have no source in this
   repository, and this file carries the same ones. The suite pins
   them by literal so that changing them here and in the module
   together still fails. Rows that agree bit for bit are a warning
   sign, not a result, so the suite asserts these DISAGREE in the last
   digits.

 - `permanent`: the permanent pressure loss in the published closed
   form, transcribed, and it says so. The real checks on it are the
   two limits (all of the differential lost at beta zero, none at beta
   one) and monotonicity, which are properties rather than values.

 - `transmitter`: the percentage of reading and the DIFFERENTIAL
   turndown against its square-root relation to the flow turndown.

 - `uncertainty`: the root-sum-square checked against a MONTE CARLO
   propagation of 200,000 perturbed samples. Two entirely different
   ways to propagate error. Genuinely independent, including the case
   where the differential term is fed by the transmitter.
