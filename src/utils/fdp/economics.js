// FDP economics, on the sanctioned engine (Economics E1).
//
// Before this module, FDP carried its OWN net present value arithmetic in
// two places (costCalculations.js and scenarioCalculations.js) - the
// sixth de facto NPV implementation in a module that had declared one
// source of truth, and the only one nobody had ever tested.
//
// The substantive problem was not duplication, it was that neither
// version applied any fiscal terms at all. "NPV" meant revenue minus
// operating cost, before royalty and before tax. On ordinary Nigerian
// terms that overstates project value by roughly forty percent, and it
// was the number the app put on a card labelled NPV at 10 percent.
//
// Both call sites now build their case here and run it through
// `calculateEconomics`, the sanctioned client-side screening engine, so
// FDP screening economics agree with the NPV Scenario Builder, the
// Probabilistic Breakeven Analyzer and the Fiscal Regime Designer. Full
// Nigerian fiscal detail still belongs to the EPE engine.
//
// CONVENTION: mid-year discounting, inherited from calculateEconomics.
