/**
 * Modular refinery feasibility (Midstream & Downstream DS4).
 *
 * DOCTRINE 1, MADE CONCRETE: MODULAR SCALE FIRST
 *
 * The tools this competes with were built for 200,000 barrel-a-day
 * stick-built refineries, and their assumptions are baked in. The most
 * consequential one is capital scaling. Stick-built cost follows the
 * six-tenths rule: doubling capacity costs about 1.5 times as much, because
 * a bigger vessel is cheaper per barrel than two smaller ones. That is the
 * single reason the industry believes small refineries cannot work.
 *
 * A modular refinery does not scale that way. You do not build a bigger
 * vessel, you build ANOTHER TRAIN, so the cost is close to linear in
 * capacity and the economy of scale largely disappears. Which cuts both
 * ways, and honestly: the small plant loses much less to scale than the
 * six-tenths rule implies, and the big one gains much less.
 *
 * This engine models BOTH exponents and shows them side by side, because the
 * comparison is the entire argument for or against a modular project and
 * burying it inside one number would be the wrong service. The exponents are
 * named, overridable parameters, not constants hidden in the code.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
 *
 * It does not compute the fiscal cash flow. That is the Suite's sanctioned
 * economics engine's job, and this engine deliberately produces the annual
 * volume and cost streams for that engine to consume rather than growing a
 * seventh NPV implementation. The Economics module spent a whole phase
 * removing the fifth and sixth.
