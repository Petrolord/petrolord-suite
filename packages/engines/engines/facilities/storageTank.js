/**
 * Atmospheric storage tank shell design, venting and losses
 * (Facilities F12a).
 *
 * Three questions that are usually asked separately and answered
 * inconsistently, put in one place because they share a geometry:
 *
 *  1. How thick does each shell course have to be (API 650, the
 *     one-foot method)?
 *  2. How much has the tank got to breathe, in and out, normally
 *     (API 2000 thermal and liquid movement) and in a fire (the
 *     wetted-area heat input)?
 *  3. How much product evaporates out of it in a year (the standing
 *     and working loss relations), which is both a money question and
 *     an emissions one?
 *
 * The venting one is where tanks are actually destroyed. A tank is a
 * thin-walled vessel designed for inches of water column, so an
 * undersized vacuum vent will pull it flat during a cold rainstorm on
 * a full tank, and an undersized pressure vent will lift the roof in
 * a fire. Both cases are computed here rather than assumed.
 *
 * WHAT THIS PACKAGE DOES NOT CARRY. Several numbers in this module
 * belong to standards that are not in this repository, and each one is
 * named where it is used rather than guessed:
 *
 *  - the API 2000 air-equivalence relation that turns a fire duty into
 *    a required vent capacity. `fireVenting` returns the duty and
 *    WITHHOLDS the vent, by name, because the two plausible forms of
 *    that relation differ by a factor of about 24 and an undersized
 *    emergency vent is the failure this module exists to prevent.
 *  - API 650's minimum shell plate thickness band table.
 *    `minimumThicknessIn` is therefore a stated input with a stated
 *    default, and the result says which value was in force.
 *  - the diameter above which API 650 requires the variable design
 *    point method instead of the one-foot method.
 *  - the API 2000 thermal venting table above the capacity at which it
 *    stops being proportional, and the latitude and insulation credits
 *    the standard allows.
 *  - AP-42's turnover factor Kn. The turnover input that never fed it
 *    has been removed rather than echoed back as though it worked.
 *
 * Units: field (ft, bbl, psi, F, scfh).
