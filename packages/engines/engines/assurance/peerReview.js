 * AS5, after riskScoring (AS2), complianceStatus (AS3) and

 * comment's disposition are decided in exactly one place.
 *
 * Peer Review Manager had three colour maps of its own, for stage,
 * priority and decision, each a switch over lower-cased strings with a
 * silent fall-through to grey. It had no disposition logic at all: the
 * comment status was whatever string the UI last assigned, so a comment
 * could be marked Verified without anyone having responded to it, and a
 * review could be Closed with unanswered Critical findings against it.
 *
 * That last one is the point of the app. A technical assurance review
 * that can be closed over an open showstopper is not an assurance
 * process; it is a list. The transitions below are what make the
 * comment loop mean something, and `canClose()` is what makes the
 * review outcome defensible.
