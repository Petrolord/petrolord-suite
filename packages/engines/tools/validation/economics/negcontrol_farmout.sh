# Economics EC10 negative controls for the farm-out engine
# (farmout.js) gate.
#
# A gate that restates the formula validates nothing, so every claim in
# FINDINGS-farmout.md about what this suite catches was produced by running
# this file: each row plants ONE defect, runs the suite, and records whether
# it went red.
#
#   ENGINE  plants go in engines/economics/farmout.js alone. All must go RED.
#   ORACLE  plants go in tools/validation/economics/oracle_farmout.py
#           alone, with the golden regenerated. All must go RED or STOP (the
#           oracle refused to write a golden).
#
#   tools/validation/economics/negcontrol_farmout.sh [filter]
#
# It edits the working tree and restores it on exit: do not stage or commit
# while it runs. The last lines report N/N engine plants red.
