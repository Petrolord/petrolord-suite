/**
 * Thermodynamic hydrate inhibition (Production P10).
 *
 * Once you know where the fluid sits against a hydrate boundary, the
 * next question is what to inject to move the boundary out of the way,
 * and how much. That is this module.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES AND DOES NOT DO. It computes the DEPRESSION an inhibitor
 * gives -- how far it shifts the hydrate temperature -- and the rate
 * needed to hold a concentration in the produced water. It does NOT
 * compute where the hydrate boundary is in the first place: that is a
 * fluid property from a lab or a compositional flash, and it belongs to
 * whoever owns the fluid.
 *
 * TWO RELATIONS, AND WHERE EACH ONE STOPS.
 *
 *   Hammerschmidt:  dT = K W / (M (100 - W))
 *
 * with W the inhibitor weight percent in the AQUEOUS phase, M its
 * molecular weight and K a single constant. It is the equation every
 * hand calculation uses and it is genuinely good to about 20 to 25
 * weight percent. Past that it over-predicts, and past about 30 it
 * over-predicts badly, because it is a dilute-solution result being
 * pushed where the assumption behind it has gone.
 *
 *   Nielsen-Bucklin:  dT = -129.6 ln(x_water)
 *
 * in mole fraction rather than weight percent, which is the right
 * variable for a freezing-point depression, and which is why it holds
 * at the high methanol concentrations Hammerschmidt does not. It was
 * developed for methanol.
 *
 * The two agree closely at moderate concentration and separate as it
 * rises. This module computes BOTH wherever both apply and reports
 * them side by side rather than choosing silently, because which one an
 * engineer trusts at 35 weight percent is a judgement and the
 * disagreement is information.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT MODELLED. Salt in the produced water inhibits too, and
 * ignoring it over-injects; but the depression from salinity depends on
 * the ions present and is a flash calculation, not a constant. It is
 * left out and said to be left out rather than approximated.
 *
 * Field units: temperature degF, weight percent, rate bbl/d.

/**
 * The inhibitors, with the molecular weights the Hammerschmidt form
