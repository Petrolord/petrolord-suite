/**
 * Production back allocation and well-test QC (Production, extracted
 * from the Suite's Production Allocation Studio P3/P6.5 layer).
 *
 * THE PROBLEM. A facility meters ONE commingled stream. The volumes
 * booked against each well are therefore an ALLOCATION, not a
 * measurement, and every barrel a well is credited with came out of an
 * arithmetic split rather than off an instrument. Back allocation
 * distributes the metered total across the wells in proportion to what
 * each was CAPABLE of producing over the period: its latest valid well
 * test, scaled by the hours it was actually on.
 *
 *   theoretical(well, day) = test rate x uptime fraction
 *   factor(phase, day)     = metered total / sum of theoretical
 *   allocated(well, day)   = theoretical x factor
 *
 * THE FACTOR IS THE OUTPUT, NOT AN INTERNAL. A factor of 1.0 means the
 * wells' tests add up to exactly what the facility measured.
 * Persistently high or low factors mean the tests, the meter or the
 * uptime record disagree, and that disagreement is the signal an
 * allocation engineer works from. So NOTHING here silently normalizes a
 * factor to 1, and nothing clamps it into the warning band: the band
 * raises a diagnostic and the number is reported as it fell out.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT INVENTED. A date with no metered total is
 * not allocated at all rather than being filled in. A well with no test
 * in force takes NO share rather than a guessed rate, and says so as a
 * diagnostic. Injectors and observation wells never take a share of
 * produced volumes.
 *
 * CLOSURE. Because every well's share is its theoretical times the one
 * factor for that phase and day, the allocated volumes sum EXACTLY to
 * the metered total whenever a factor exists. That identity is the
 * first thing the gate checks, and it is the property that makes an
 * allocation defensible.
 *
 * UNITS. Field units throughout, as everywhere else in
 * engines/production. They are not converted internally and they are
 * not optional. This module is a LEDGER module, so its primary
 * quantities are VOLUMES over a day, with rates appearing only where a
 * well test states one:
 *
 *   oil / water volume    stb per ledger row (a calendar day)
 *   gas volume            Mscf per ledger row
 *   oil / water test rate stb/d
 *   gas test rate         Mscf/d
 *   hours on stream       h, 0 to 24
 *   tubing head pressure  psia (crossCheckTestsAgainstNodal only)
 *   watercut              a 0-1 fraction, never a percentage
 *   gas-oil ratio         scf/stb
 *   dates                 ISO yyyy-mm-dd, read as UTC midnight
 *
 * WHAT IS INJECTED, AND WHY. `crossCheckTestsAgainstNodal` takes the
 * well-model builder and the node solver as FUNCTIONS. Same discipline
 * as `nodal.solveNodeCore`: the check is about comparing a measured
 * rate against a solved one and about classifying the outcome, and it
 * is checkable without judgement when the solver is a stub whose answer
 * is known. It also lets a consumer hand in its own validated inflow
 * and multiphase traverse rather than have this module invent one.
 *
 * VALIDATION NOTE. Gated against
 * tools/validation/production/oracle_allocation.py through
 * test-data/production/goldens/allocation_cases.json. The oracle is
 * written from the method statement, not by transcribing this file:
 * it splits the metered total as `measured * theoretical_i / sum
 * theoretical` (the share form) where this module multiplies by a
 * precomputed factor; it selects the test in force by building each
 * test's explicit validity interval and bisecting into it where this
 * module scans forward and breaks; and it forms each monthly factor as
 * the THEORETICAL-VOLUME-WEIGHTED MEAN of that month's daily factors
 * where this module divides one month total by another, which is what
 * actually tests the "volume weighted" claim rather than assuming it.

// ---- the nodal cross-check -------------------------------------------------

// The strongest test QC there is, and the one that needs a well model.
// A well test records a rate and a tubing head pressure. Feed that
// pressure to the well's own model, solve the node where inflow meets
// outflow, and the rate that falls out is what the well SHOULD have
// made at that wellhead pressure. A test that disagrees badly with its
// own well is either a bad test or a well that has changed, and both
// are worth knowing before that test is used to allocate a month of
// production.
//
// It is kept OUT of validateWellTests deliberately. Every check in
// there is arithmetic on rows already in memory; this one marches a
// multiphase traverse per rate per test, so it is an explicit run a
// consumer asks for rather than something that happens on every render.
