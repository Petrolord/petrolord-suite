/**
 * Artificial lift screening (Production P9).
 *
 * The rules-based first pass: given what a well is and what the
 * facility can supply, which lift methods are worth considering at all.
 * It replaces `utils/liftSystemScreening.js`, which the P0 audit found
 * to be the one honest part of the old Artificial Lift Designer, and
 * extends it from three methods to six.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. Operating guidance, not physics. Every deduction below
 * is a rule of thumb an experienced production engineer would recognise
 * and could argue with, and the reasons are spelled out precisely so
 * they CAN be argued with rather than hidden inside a score. Nothing
 * here is derived from anything.
 *
 * WHY IT STILL EARNS ITS PLACE. Two of the six methods -- progressing
 * cavity and jet pumps -- have no validated engine in this Suite, so
 * screening is all there is for them and saying so plainly is better
 * than leaving them out. For the other four, screening is a fast first
 * pass that the ACTUAL DESIGN then either confirms or overturns, and
 * when the two disagree the design wins because it solved the well.
 * `liftAdvisor` is what runs that comparison.
 *
 * Every method carries `hasEngine`, so the advisor can never present a
 * screened opinion as though it were a design.
