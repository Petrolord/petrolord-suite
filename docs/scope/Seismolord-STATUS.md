# Seismolord — STATUS

Last updated: 2026-07-10

## Current state: walking skeleton

The end-to-end path exists and nothing more: page → `seismolord-engine`
edge function → test manifest in the private `seismic` Storage bucket →
`{status:"ok"}` rendered on the page. No interpretation functionality yet.
See `docs/scope/Seismolord-PLAYBOOK.md` for the target product; the
playbook's Node/Express + Python architecture is future scope — the
skeleton uses the Suite's standard Supabase Edge Function path.

## What exists

- **Route**: `/dashboard/apps/geoscience/seismolord` (`src/App.jsx`),
  gated by `ProtectedAppRoute appId="seismolord"`.
- **Page shell**: `src/pages/apps/Seismolord/Seismolord.jsx` — header +
  a backend-connectivity card that invokes `seismolord-engine` on mount
  and renders the JSON result. Folder-based app archetype (like
  ReservoirCalcPro) so canvas/store/services can grow inside it.
- **Catalog**: `master_apps` row seeded by
  `supabase/migrations/20260710120500_seed_seismolord_app.sql`
  (slug `seismolord`, module Geoscience, status Active, icon `Waves`).
- **DB**: `public.seismic_volumes` (volume registry; metadata only) via
  `supabase/migrations/20260710120000_create_seismic_volumes.sql`.
  User-scoped RLS (`auth.uid() = user_id`), the Suite's house pattern.
- **Edge function**: `supabase/functions/seismolord-engine/` — verifies
  the caller's JWT (anon client + forwarded Authorization header), reads
  `seismic/test/manifest.json` with the service-role client, returns
  `{status:"ok", manifest}`. Deployed separately via
  `supabase functions deploy seismolord-engine`.
- **Storage**: private `seismic` bucket created 2026-07-10 with
  `test/manifest.json` uploaded. NOTE: a legacy public `seismic-files`
  bucket (SEG-Y mime types, 2025-10-07) also exists from the deleted
  seismic apps — Seismolord does not use it; candidate for cleanup.

## Decisions

- RLS: user-scoped now; org scoping deferred until the suite standardizes
  on one membership table (three inconsistent ones exist today).
- Bucket: new private `seismic` (deployment-checklist name). The legacy
  `seismic-files` bucket was rejected: public + mime-restricted to SEG-Y.
- Tile status: `Active` immediately (owner's call). Caveat: staging and
  production share the Supabase project, so the tile is visible on
  petrolord.com before the SPA route ships there — until the next manual
  production build upload, clicking it hits the catch-all redirect home.

## Not built yet (per playbook)

SEG-Y ingest/indexing, WebGL2 section/slice viewer, Zustand store, Web
Worker decoding, horizon/fault picking, gridding, XYZ/CPS-3/ZMAP+ export,
storage RLS policies on the `seismic` bucket (skeleton reads it with the
service role inside the function only), brick file format, master_apps
pricing/entitlement review for the `seismolord` appId.
