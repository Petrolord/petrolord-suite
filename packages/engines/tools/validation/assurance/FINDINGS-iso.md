# FINDINGS: isoCompliance (AS8, ISO Compliance)

Oracle: `tools/validation/assurance/oracle_iso.py` (stdlib Python 3), which
writes `isoCompliance_cases.json`: 186 cases, 5 knownDefect (ISO-1, ISO-2
x2, ISO-3, CAL-1). Every other case agrees with the engine. Every function
export has a case, including the re-exports.

Sources: the module docstrings, AssuranceApps-STATUS.md §3g, migration
20260917600000, ISO 9001:2015 §4.3, §9.2 and §10.2, and ISO 19011. Dates
are modelled with `datetime.date`.

## ISO-1: `summarise()` ignores each standard's certification cycle

Case `summary-honours-standard-cycle`, today 2026-09-17. One standard has
`cycle_years: 1` and two evidenced clauses: c1 was last examined internally
on 2025-03-01, c2 on 2026-09-01.

- Engine: clausesCovered 2, clausesStale 0.
- Oracle: 1 and 1.

`summarise()` calls `clauseCoverage` with no `cycleYears`, so every clause
is judged against three years. `cycle_years` is a real column (check 1 to
6, editable on the Standards page), and `certificationReadiness()` does use
it. On the same data, case `ready-agrees-with-summary-cycle` shows
readiness reporting c1 as stale while the dashboard summary counts it as
covered.

Blast radius:

- iso-compliance `Dashboard.jsx` lines 76-78 (the coverage chart, shown
  next to the readiness cards).
- `Reports.jsx` lines 184-212.
- The Assurance hub.
- Suite-side, `ClauseRegister.jsx:90` and `Reports.jsx:67` also call
  `clauseCoverage` without `cycleYears`.

Only standards whose cycle is not three years are affected.

## ISO-2: `findingAgeDays()` keeps counting after closure

Cases `age-closed-stops-at-closure` and `age-voided-stops`.

- Closed finding, raised 2026-01-01 and closed 2026-02-01: engine 259,
  oracle 31.
- Voided finding, raised 2026-03-01 and closed 2026-03-04: engine 200,
  oracle 3.

Age is how long the finding was open. `qualityAssurance.ncrAgeDays` already
stops at `closed_date`, and both findings tables store `closed_date` with a
check that `closed_date >= raised_date`.

Blast radius: the iso `FindingDetail.jsx` Age tile, the iso
`FindingsRegister.jsx` CSV and, through the re-export, the audit-manager
`FindingDetail.jsx` and `Findings.jsx` CSV. Open findings are unaffected.

## ISO-3: on 29 February the cycle starts on 1 March

Case `coverage-leap-day-boundary`: today is 2028-02-29, the cycle is three
years, and the clause was last examined on 2025-02-28.

- Engine: covered false, stale true.
- Oracle: covered true, stale false.

`new Date(2025, 1, 29)` rolls over to 2025-03-01. Postgres intervals,
date-fns `subYears` and dateutil all step back to 28 February instead. The
roll-over is a side effect of the Date constructor, not a decision.

Low severity. The neighbouring days (`coverage-leap-day-agreed`,
`coverage-leap-to-leap`, `coverage-march-first`) are pinned and agree.

## CAL-1 (shared)

`parseDateOnly('2026-02-30')` returns 2026-03-02 rather than null. See
FINDINGS-calendar.md. It is pinned once here (`parse-feb-30`) because of
the re-export.

## Rules taken from the code, not the docs

- **Blocker order:** blockers are ordered within each severity, and the
  "no applicable clauses" blocker comes first with `count: 0`.
- **Coverage fallback:** when `examined_on` is missing, coverage falls back
  to `audits.actual_end`. The schema makes `examined_on` mandatory, so this
  only affects rows that cannot be stored.
- **`isAssessed`:** requires an assessed date.
- **Lead-day limits are inclusive:** a certificate 90 days out counts as
  expiring, and one 91 days out does not.
- **Nonconformant status:** requires a date and an assessor, but no
  evidence reference.

## Ambiguities for the owner (not pinned)

1. Cancelled and in-progress internal audits still count as coverage. ISO
   9001 §9.2.2(c) expects results to be reported.
2. Independence is checked for the lead auditor only. `audit_team` is free
   text.
3. An expired certificate appears only in `counts`, never as a blocker.
4. When one clause has two examinations on the same day with different
   results, the engine keeps the first row it meets.

## Status after AS12 (2026-09-18)

Every knownDefect in this file was REPAIRED in the engine in the same
wave (engines PR "AS12"), and each case now carries `"repaired": "<id>"`
instead of `"knownDefect"`, so it is gated like any other case and a
regression fails the suite. The ambiguities listed above for the owner
were NOT changed; they are recorded in the Suite's
docs/scope/AssuranceApps-STATUS.md §3k for decision.

## AS15 (2026-09-18): owner decisions

The owner delegated the open §3k.4 questions (Suite
AssuranceApps-STATUS.md). Three changed this module.

- **AS15-Q4, coverage counts reported results only.** `clauseCoverage`,
  and everything built on it (`clauseCoverageByStandard`, `summarise`,
  `certificationReadiness`), counted an examination from an audit that was
  Planned, In progress, Fieldwork complete or Cancelled. ISO 9001
  §9.2.2(c) asks for audit results to be reported. Now only Reported and
  Closed audits count (`COVERAGE_COUNTING_STATUSES`). An audit with no
  status counts for nothing. A later examination in an unreported audit
  does not displace an earlier reported one. The fixtures of the older
  coverage and readiness cases were given Reported/Closed audits so they
  still test the cycle arithmetic. `summary-mixed` deliberately keeps a
  Fieldwork-complete audit and moves. Cases `coverage-only-reported-results`,
  `coverage-by-standard-only-reported`, `summary-only-reported-results`,
  `ready-unreported-examinations-are-never-audited`,
  `coverage-audit-with-no-status`.
- **AS15-Q5, independence for every examiner.** New
  `canExamineClause(clause, examinerId)`: whoever records a clause's
  examination result may not own the clause. There is no audit-team table,
  so the examiner is the signed-in person recording the result. Before
  this, only the lead auditor was checked. Cases `examine-*`.
- **AS15-Q6, the certificate is a listed item.** A lapsed certificate
  was only a count. It is now a `serious` item (certification cannot be
  claimed, and surveillance becomes recertification). It is not
  `blocking`, because the management system is not made unready by it.
  A certificate inside the 90-day lead (0 to 90 days) is a `watch` item.
  At 91 days nothing is listed, and an unreadable date lists nothing.
  Cases `ready-cert-*`, `ready-messy`, `ready-one-year-cycle-expired`,
  `ready-cert-90-days`.
- **Engine defect found while writing the oracle (fixed).** The AS15 edit
  pushed the certificate entry after the watch items. That broke the
  module's blocking, serious, watch ordering: `ready-messy` listed a
  `serious` item after three `watch` items. `certificationReadiness` now
  stable-sorts the list by severity before the "no applicable clauses"
  entry is put first. Case `ready-cert-lapsed-sits-among-serious`.

Negative control: against the pre-AS15 engine every case above fails
(canExamineClause does not exist there).
