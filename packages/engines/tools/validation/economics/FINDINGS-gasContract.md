# FINDINGS: gasContract (oracle_gascontract.py, Economics EC8, gas sales agreements)

Engine: `engines/economics/gasContract.js` (the brief allowed another name; it
is `gasContract.js`). Golden: `test-data/economics/goldens/gascontract_cases.json`,
196 cases (90 of them refusals, every refusal message pinned in full),
written by `tools/validation/economics/oracle_gascontract.py`. Gate:
`__tests__/economics.gasContract.test.js` (234 tests) calls the engine on
every golden, checks the published figures against their printed values,
checks the planted fixture situations and the wiring, and runs property tests.
Negative control: `negcontrol_gascontract.sh` (63/63 engine plants red, 7/7 oracle plants caught, after the domestic-ceiling repair). Timing:
`timing_gascontract.js` (table below). Fixtures: `test-data/economics/ekene-gsa/`,
written by `make_gsa_fixtures.py`. Full engines suite on the branch: 230 suites passed, 17,789 tests passed on fix/gas-domestic-ceiling (17,774 on the first PR, after `npm ci` in the worktree). Before `npm ci` the worktree had no node_modules and 9 suites (7 CRS, 2 downstream copy-rule) could not resolve `proj4` and `@babel/parser`; a clean checkout of origin/main run the same way failed the same 9 suites with the same messages (9 failed, 2 tests failed, 218 passed), so that was environment only. CI on the PR is green.

The oracle is STDLIB ONLY (python 3: `fractions`, `decimal`, `math`,
`datetime`). It reads no JavaScript and takes a different road: quantities
and money as exact Fractions of the input doubles; the take-or-pay year as the
Model GSA formulas evaluated as written over a dated ledger of entries
(deficiency year, last year, quantity); the 4-decimal rule on Decimal digits;
the gas royalty rate re-derived from the PIA Seventh Schedule para 10(6)
without importing `cashflow.ts`; NPV as an exact Fraction sum. Figures printed
inside a message are the double nearest the exact value; the one figure the
engine prints from a chain of doubles (the negative-price refusal) is replayed
in doubles in the engine's stated order. The fixtures keep quantities whole so
that printed quantities agree exactly.

No new NPV or Monte Carlo: the engine imports `npv`, `deriveGasRoyaltyRate`
and `calendarDays` from `engines/economics/cashflow.ts`; nothing here samples.

## Fixtures (synthetic, ours)

`test-data/economics/ekene-gsa/domestic-power.json` (the Ekene Power Plant,
2027 to 2034, DCQ 21,000 MMBtu/d, TOP 80%, make-up 3 years after the Adjusted
ACQ, forfeit at the end, the power price = the domestic base price held at the
reported 2026 US$2.18 as a stated planning assumption, seller shortfall at a
stated 1.25; a January 2027 day by day; the 2028 DGDO) and `export-feed.json`
(the Ekene Export Feed Buyer, 2027 to 2036, DCQ 63,000 MMBtu/d, TOP 90%,
make-up 5 years after the TOPQ, refund at the end, carry-forward 3 years
capped at 50% of a deficiency, an oil-indexed S-curve price on a synthetic oil
index with a 6-month average, a 1-month lag, a quarterly reset, 4-decimal
rounding and two reopeners). The README lists every planted situation and the
gate asserts each one. Onshore terrain, as the EC7 Ekene onshore cases; the
Ekene oil field's associated gas volumes are not used.

## Published figures (goldens, printed values beside)

No freely available public text found on 2026-09-26 prints a multi-year
take-or-pay and make-up worked table (the texts that do are licensed, AIPN and
Roberts 2020, or paywalled, Energy Economics 2018). The ledger goldens are
therefore oracle goldens from the Model GSA clause arithmetic (source 4) with
the recovery orders of ESMAP and HMRC (sources 5 and 6). The printed figures
the gate checks:

| case | source | printed | engine |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cq-hmrc-ot05402-effective-swing` | HMRC OT05402 | 150 / 90 = 1.66; a factor of 6.6 | 1.6666666666666667 (the manual truncates: printed alike is not equal) |
| `price-ecs-figure-51` | ECS 2007 Figure 51 | A 0.1485, B 0.80, floor at 15, cap at 30, axis 2.50 to 5.50 | flat 3.0275 below 15, flat 5.255 above 30, linear between |
| `parity-ecs-0172` | ECS 2007 section 4.5.3.3 | 0.172 | 1 / 5.8 = 0.1724137931034483 (5.8 MMBtu per barrel, the conventional crude heat content; 1 / 0.172 = 5.814) |
| `parity-eia-2026` | EIA (source 11) | 5,689,000 Btu per barrel | 1 / 5.689 = 0.17577781683951485 |
| `price-oies-hub-csp` | OIES NG 175 | CSP = 1.15 x HH + Xy | 1.15 per unit of HH (Xy 2.25 is ours) |

## Lead decisions (2026-09-26), applied

1. **Domestic base price**: a REQUIRED input with no default. The figures are
   stated only in this form: US$2.18 per MMBtu (power) and US$2.68 per MMBtu
   (commercial), effective 1 April 2026, reported by BusinessDay (31 March
   2026) and by Advocaat Law Practice through Legal 500 (7 April 2026); the
   regulator's circular was not read. The lead also found only secondary
   reports (TheCable, Leadership, Business Post). The course may quote them
   only in this form and never grades them. The `domesticPrice` basis carries
   the same sentence.
2. **Flare penalty**: not implemented; concept only (no dated, numbered
   public text).
3. **Readings confirmed**, each verbatim in its basis string (pinned by the
   gate):
   - `dailyBalance` basis.reading: "seller shortfall measured against the quantity the seller made available"
   - `takeOrPay` basis.reading: "make-up right equals the deficiency actually paid after any carry-forward credit" and "a last-contract-year deficiency creates no make-up right (forfeit/refund applies to earlier years' make-up only)"
   - `gsaCashFlows` basis.royalty: "royalty is charged on delivered gas value and not on deficiency payments"
4. **Recovery order**: a REQUIRED input with no default. The `takeOrPay`
   basis names 'after-adjusted-acq' as the reference text's order
   (Commonwealth model GSA Article 12.7.1); 'after-top-quantity' and 'first'
   are variants the engine also computes.
5. **Not computed** (concept only): excess gas; over-delivery;
   off-specification gas; the index rate-of-change cap (model GSA Article 15.8
   Alternative 2); the outcome of a price review (reopeners are reported only);
   the DGDO Regulations' 90-day investigation rule (r.6(3) and (4)). Also not
   computed: pre-start gas, the model GSA's extend-the-term alternative and
   carry-forward Alternative 1, customer compensation (s.110(13)), the Third
   Schedule tier allocation, the flare penalty.

## Decisions and refinements of the lead's scope

1. **Function set.** `toEnergy`, `contractQuantities`, `dailyBalance`,
   `takeOrPay`, `priceSeries`, `energyParitySlope`, `domesticPrice`,
   `domesticGasObligation`, `gsaCashFlows`. Every one refuses an unknown key at
   every level (`ACCEPTED_KEYS`), as tender.js does.
2. **One refusal wording.** "<field> must <condition>; got <value>" (the value
   as JavaScript prints it, strings quoted, an absent value as "nothing"), or
   "<field> is not an accepted key; the accepted keys ... are ...". The gate
   checks the pattern on every refusal golden.
3. **Seller shortfall reading.** The Model GSA prints SFQ = (PNQ - DTQ) - DAQ
   for a day the seller did not make the nominated quantity available. The
   engine subtracts the quantity MADE AVAILABLE, so gas made available and not
   taken never counts as the seller's shortfall. Stated in the basis.
4. **Make-up entitlement.** The entry is the deficiency quantity actually
   paid for (BADQ less any carry-forward credit); the model's MUA formula sums
   BADQ. Stated.
5. **Last contract year.** A deficiency of the last year opens no make-up
   entry (the MUA sums prior years only), and the end-of-term rule (forfeit, or
   refund at the last year's take-or-pay price, Article 12.7.5 Alternatives 1
   and 2) applies to the earlier entries still open. Without this reading the
   refund would hand back the last year's own deficiency payment. Alternative 3
   (extend the term) is not modelled.
6. **Recovery orders, all explicit (no default).** 'after-adjusted-acq'
   (Model GSA 12.7.1), 'after-top-quantity' (ESMAP 6.59; HMRC "only when the
   minimum ... has been taken"), 'first' (HMRC "in priority over that period's
   contract amount"). In the annual reconciliation the year's make-up is the
   taken quantity above the threshold (the buyer designates make-up as soon as
   it may).
7. **Carry-forward.** Off unless stated. Applied to the deficiency (Model GSA
   12.8 Alternative 2), capped at a stated % of that deficiency; the surplus is
   measured above the Adjusted ACQ (Model GSA BASQ) or above the take-or-pay
   quantity (ESMAP 6.61), as stated. Alternative 1 (reduce next year's ACQ) is
   not modelled.
8. **Not modelled** (taught as concept): excess gas (EGQ, ERQ), over-delivery,
   off-specification and pre-start gas, the operational flexibility credit as
   an election (it enters as `permittedReduction`), the index change cap
   (Article 15.8 Alternative 2), the outcome of a price review (reopeners are
   reported only), the DGDO 90-day investigation (r.6(3)) and customer
   compensation (s.110(13)), the Third Schedule tier allocation.
9. **Royalty.** On the value of gas delivered (taken x contract price) at the
   canonical `deriveGasRoyaltyRate`; a deficiency payment is money for gas not
   produced and carries none here (the gas pays when it is made up). A reading,
   stated in the basis.
10. **Btu.** The International Table Btu. The Model GSA defines its Btu at
    59 F to 60 F (about 1054.80 J, 0.02% smaller); a contract on that Btu
    should state its heating value in those units.
11. **4-decimal rounding.** The price is normalised to 12 significant digits
    before its fifth decimal decides, so float noise cannot flip the digit;
    the gate pins 11.23459 to 11.2346, 11.23449 to 11.2345 and 100.00005 to
    100.0001.
12. **Printed money.** Reasons print the double the engine holds, so the
    export refund 457950 x 8.0813 prints 3700831.3350000004. Lessons should
    quote the numeric fields at 6 decimals.

## Repair fix/gas-domestic-ceiling (2026-09-26): key-truth audit EF-1/EF-2 and the Associate audit

Read again from the gazetted text (`/root/cat-wip-pia/sources/pia_nuprc.txt`): s.167(7) says the distributor
price "shall not exceed that of the commercial sector"; s.167(3) says "The price control and the corresponding
role of the domestic gas aggregator shall not be required, where the (a) entire domestic gas demand requirement
under section 173 (2) is covered by contracts under sections 110 (2) and 173 (3) of this Act; or (b) domestic
market for natural gas is largely characterised by free market based contracting ... and at such time the
provisions of subsections (4), (5), (6) and (7) and section 168 shall no longer be applicable". The
`domesticPrice` basis source now quotes s.167(3).

1. **EF-1, s.167(7) held like s.168(3).** Under price control a distributor figure above the commercial price
   is held at it: `price` is the lawful figure, `statedPrice` the negotiated figure, `withinCeiling: false`,
   `heldAt: 'ceiling'`, and the reason cites s.167(7) and says the figure was held. The gas based industries
   formula already worked this way (`formulaPrice` beside `price`, `heldAt`). Both ceilings now share the
   `heldAt` field and the "so the price is held at ... (section)" reason. Before the repair `dp-distributor-above`
   returned price 2.9 with `withinCeiling: false` and no clamp; it now returns 2.68.
2. **EF-2, s.167(3)(b).** `priceControlApplies` is a REQUIRED true or false with no default. When false, every
   sector's price is its negotiated price (required), no s.167 or s.168 ceiling or floor applies, the Fourth
   Schedule inputs are refused, and the reason cites s.167(3)(b). The domestic base price is required only under
   price control.
3. **permittedReduction required** (Associate audit). Every takeOrPay and gsaCashFlows contract year must state
   it (0 when the contract permits none). Every golden and both fixtures now state it. The cases that relied on
   the silent 0: every takeOrPay and gsaCashFlows golden except `top-force-majeure-and-shortfall` (which stated
   30); all now state 0 and their expected values are unchanged.
4. **A take-or-pay percentage of 0** is still accepted; each year's reasons and the basis say "a take-or-pay
   percentage of 0 sets no take-or-pay quantity" (golden `top-zero-percent`).

**Which goldens moved.** Compared against the golden file of the first PR (d745b88):
- values: only `dp-distributor-above` (price 2.9 to 2.68, new `statedPrice` and `heldAt`, new reason);
- wording or new keys in domesticPrice only: every other domesticPrice golden gains `priceControlApplies: true`
  in its input and output; the distributor goldens gain `statedPrice` and `heldAt` and a reason citing s.167(7);
  `dp-refuse-negotiated-for-power` reads "... while priceControlApplies is true"; the two unknown-key refusals
  list `priceControlApplies` among the accepted keys;
- no expected value of any other function moved: the 47 takeOrPay and gsaCashFlows cases whose inputs gained
  `permittedReduction: 0` have byte-identical expected outputs;
- added (11): `dp-distributor-above-no-control`, `dp-distributor-at-ceiling-no-control`, `dp-power-no-control`,
  `dp-gbi-no-control-below-floor`, `dp-refuse-no-control-flag`, `dp-refuse-control-flag-text`,
  `dp-refuse-no-control-no-price`, `dp-refuse-no-control-with-formula`, `top-refuse-missing-permitted-reduction`,
  `top-refuse-permitted-reduction-negative`, `top-zero-percent`.

New refusal strings (course content):
- `years[0].permittedReduction must be stated for every contract year (0 when the contract permits none); the engine holds no default; got nothing`
- `priceControlApplies must be true or false, stated: whether the price control of PIA s.167 applies, or the free-market criteria of s.167(3)(b) are met (no default); got nothing`
- `priceControlApplies must be true or false, stated: whether the price control of PIA s.167 applies, or the free-market criteria of s.167(3)(b) are met (no default); got "yes"`
- `negotiatedPrice must be stated when priceControlApplies is false: every sector negotiates its price (PIA s.167(3)(b)); got nothing`
- `product must be given only when priceControlApplies is true (the Fourth Schedule formula is part of s.168); got "urea"`

New reasons:
- `the negotiated price 2.9 exceeds the commercial sector price 2.68, so the price is held at 2.68 (s.167(7))`
- `the negotiated price 2.5 is at or below the commercial sector price 2.68, the ceiling for gas distributors (s.167(7))`
- `price control does not apply: the negotiated price 2.9 stands, with no ceiling or floor, because s.167(4) to (7) and s.168 no longer apply once the free-market criteria are met (s.167(3)(b))`
- `2027: a take-or-pay percentage of 0 sets no take-or-pay quantity`

Negative control after the repair (`negcontrol_fix.txt`): 63/63 engine plants red, 7/7 oracle plants caught. New
plants: s.167(7) clamp removed; s.167(3) flag ignored; s.167 vs s.168 inconsistency (distributor held at the base
price); s.168(3) ceiling dropped; priceControlApplies defaulting to true; permittedReduction silently 0; TOP 0 not
stated; oracle s.167(7) not held.

## Caps and timing

`timing_gascontract.js`, one run on the build host, 2026-09-26 (ms per call):

| case | size | ms |
|---|---|---|
| takeOrPay with carry-forward | 30 years | 3.66 |
| gsaCashFlows | 30 years | 1.20 |
| takeOrPay with carry-forward | 100 years | 11.38 |
| gsaCashFlows | 100 years | 2.34 |
| dailyBalance | 366 days | 5.12 |
| priceSeries oil-indexed S-curve | 1,188 months priced | 22.18 |
| priceSeries basket | 1,188 months priced | 29.13 |
| takeOrPay power fixture | 8 years | 0.56 |

Caps (`DEFAULTS`): 100 contract years, 400 days in a daily balance, 1,200 index months and 1,200 priced months, 10 basket indices. At every cap a call stays well under 100 ms.

## Negative control

Run on 2026-09-26 (`negcontrol_run2.txt` in the wave dir, then the one plant it missed rerun after a golden was added). Result: **56/56 engine plants red, 6/6 oracle plants caught.** Re-run after the lead decisions (`negcontrol_run3.txt`): 56/56 red, 6/6 caught, none skipped. The first run found two holes, both fixed before this run: the 12-digit normalisation of the 4-decimal rule is an equivalent mutation at realistic magnitudes (JavaScript `toFixed(12)` already absorbs the float noise), so that plant was replaced by the real defect of rounding to 5 decimals before the rule (golden 11.234346 gives 11.2343); and the singular 'contract year' had no golden with a one-year make-up period (added `top-makeup-period-one`).

### Reasons (from the fixture and boundary goldens)

- 2027: seller shortfall 6300 reduces the Adjusted ACQ and is paid to the buyer at 1.25: 7875
- 2028: 5460000 counted against the take-or-pay quantity 6148800 leaves a deficiency of 688800; the deficiency payment is 688800 x 2.18 = 1501584; the buyer may make up 688800 in the 3 contract years after 2028, to the end of 2031
- 2029: make-up of 210000 taken from the make-up aggregate 688800 (make-up only after the Adjusted ACQ of the year is taken), first in first out: 210000 from 2028
- 2030: make-up aggregate 478800 available and none taken, because taken 7665000 does not exceed the Adjusted ACQ 7665000
- 2031: make-up of 268800 taken from the make-up aggregate 478800 (make-up only after the Adjusted ACQ of the year is taken), first in first out: 268800 from 2028
- 2031: make-up of 210000 from 2028 expired unrecovered at the end of 2031, the last year of its make-up period
- 2033: 5775000 counted against the take-or-pay quantity 6132000 leaves a deficiency of 357000; the deficiency payment is 357000 x 2.18 = 778260; the buyer may make up 357000 in the 3 contract years after 2033, to the end of 2036
- 2034: make-up of 105000 taken from the make-up aggregate 357000 (make-up only after the Adjusted ACQ of the year is taken), first in first out: 105000 from 2033
- 2034: the delivery period ends with make-up of 252000 unrecovered; the buyer forfeits it
- 2027: 22995000 counted exceeds the take-or-pay quantity 20695500 by 2299500, carried forward to the end of 2030
- 2028: 22366000 counted exceeds the take-or-pay quantity 20752200 by 1613800, carried forward to the end of 2031
- 2029: 14257000 counted against the take-or-pay quantity 20695500 leaves a deficiency of 6438500; a carry-forward credit of 3219250 (at most 50% of the deficiency, first in first out: 2299500 from 2027, 919750 from 2028) leaves 3219250; the deficiency payment is 3219250 x 9.80845 = 31575852.6625; the buyer may make up 3219250 in the 5 contract years after 2029, to the end of 2034
- 2030: make-up of 1823500 taken from the make-up aggregate 3219250 (make-up only after the take-or-pay quantity of the year is taken), first in first out: 1823500 from 2029
- 2031: make-up of 1395750 taken from the make-up aggregate 1395750 (make-up only after the take-or-pay quantity of the year is taken), first in first out: 1395750 from 2029
- 2031: 22519250 counted exceeds the take-or-pay quantity 20695500 by 1823750, carried forward to the end of 2034
- 2031: carry-forward of 694050 from 2028 expired unused at the end of 2031
- 2032: 19599000 counted against the take-or-pay quantity 20752200 leaves a deficiency of 1153200; a carry-forward credit of 576600 (at most 50% of the deficiency, first in first out: 576600 from 2031) leaves 576600; the deficiency payment is 576600 x 7.7569 = 4472628.54; the buyer may make up 576600 in the 5 contract years after 2032, to the end of 2037
