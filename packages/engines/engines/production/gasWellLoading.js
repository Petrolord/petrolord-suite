/**
 * Liquid loading in gas wells (Production P7).
 *
 * A gas well carries its own liquid up as entrained droplets. Below
 * some rate the gas can no longer do that, droplets fall back, liquid
 * accumulates in the tubing, and the growing column kills the well.
 * The rate at which that starts is the single most useful number in
 * gas well surveillance, and it is what this module computes.
 *
 * TURNER'S EQUATION IS DERIVED HERE, NOT QUOTED. The whole thing falls
 * out of two statements about the largest droplet the gas can hold up:
 *
 *   1. At terminal velocity, drag balances weight less buoyancy.
 *        Cd (pi d^2 / 4) rho_g v^2 / (2 gc) = (pi d^3 / 6)(rho_L - rho_g)
 *
 *   2. A droplet bigger than a critical Weber number shatters, so the
 *      largest STABLE droplet is set by
 *        We = rho_g v^2 d / (sigma gc) = We_crit
 *
 * Eliminating d between them gives
 *
 *        v = [ 40 gc^2 sigma (rho_L - rho_g) / (Cd rho_g^2) ]^(1/4)
 *
 * and with Cd = 0.44, We_crit = 30, gc = 32.174 and sigma in dyne/cm
 * the bracket collapses to 1.5936, which IS the 1.593 every gas-well
 * text prints. The gates check that. Deriving it rather than
 * remembering it means the drag coefficient and the critical Weber
 * number are visible inputs a user can argue with, instead of being
 * buried inside a constant.
 *
 * TURNER AND COLEMAN ARE THE SAME EQUATION. Turner et al. (1969) found
 * their field data sat about 20 percent above the theoretical velocity
 * and applied that adjustment. Coleman et al. (1991), working on wells
 * below about 1,000 psi wellhead pressure, found the UNADJUSTED
 * equation fitted better. So the two differ by one factor, and this
 * module treats them that way rather than as two correlations.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT INVENTED HERE. Interfacial tension and liquid density
 * are inputs. Water and condensate differ by a factor of three in
 * tension and are not interchangeable, and neither is a function of
 * anything this module knows. Turner's own values are offered as
 * labelled starting points, not as correlations.
 *
 * Field units: sigma dyne/cm, densities lb/ft3, velocity ft/s,
 * pressure psia, temperature degR, area ft2, rate Mscf/d.
