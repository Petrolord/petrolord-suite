# FINDINGS: qualityAssurance (AS12 oracle, group B)

Oracle: `tools/validation/assurance/oracle_quality.py`. Golden:
`qualityAssurance_cases.json` (296 cases).

Independence: the engine was read once, for signatures, fields and
vocabularies only. The oracle was written from the four docstring rules,
STATUS §3f, ISO 9001:2015 §8.7 and §10.2, and inspection and test plan
(ITP) hold and witness point practice. Percentages and mean ages round
half up (12.5 becomes 13, 1.5 becomes 2).

## Disagreements

The engine and the oracle agree on every rule case except CAL-1, which
comes from the calendar.js re-export: `parseDateOnly('2026-04-31')` returns
2026-05-01 where the oracle returns null. Case: parse-31-april.

## Rules taken from the code, not the docs

- R1. PLAN_TRANSITIONS: a Draft may go straight to Active, and only an
  Active plan can close.
- R2. `canCloseNcr` treats a CAPA with no status as open.
- R3. `ncrAgeDays` takes the first present of raised_date and created_at.
  A closed NCR with no closed_date keeps ageing to today.
- R4. `capasAwaitingEffectiveness` counts every Complete CAPA that has no
  effectiveness verdict.
- R5. NCR urgency order: serious and overdue, serious, overdue, open,
  closed. Ties sort by due_date, else raised_date, earliest first.
- R6. An NCR raised in the future has a negative age.

## For the owner's attention

- O1. A HOLD point can be set "Not applicable" with no date, verifier or
  reason, and that clears it for plan closure. "Waived" has the same effect
  but needs a verifier and a reason.
- O2. A CAPA marked effectiveness_verified:true with no record of who
  checked it falls in no effectiveness bucket. The database constraint
  should prevent that row.

## Status after AS12 (2026-09-18)

Every knownDefect in this file was REPAIRED in the engine in the same
wave (engines PR "AS12"), and each case now carries `"repaired": "<id>"`
instead of `"knownDefect"`, so it is gated like any other case and a
regression fails the suite. The ambiguities listed above for the owner
were NOT changed; they are recorded in the Suite's
docs/scope/AssuranceApps-STATUS.md §3k for decision.

## AS13-0 (2026-09-18): O1 decided

A HOLD point set to "Not applicable" now needs the same record as a
waiver: the date, who decided, and a reason. It clears the point for plan
closure exactly as a waiver does, so it cannot be the quieter route.
Other point types may still be marked not applicable freely. Cases
`decide-hold-na-*`, `decide-witness-not-applicable-bare`.

## AS14 (2026-09-18): three rules the Suite had no answer to

- **QA-AS14-1.** `summarise` counted inspection points on closed,
  superseded and cancelled plans as outstanding and overdue, and
  corrective actions on voided NCRs as open, overdue and awaiting an
  effectiveness check. Nobody can act on either (the parent is locked).
  Work counts now skip them; totals, failures and the effectiveness
  record still include them. A child whose parent is not supplied still
  counts. Cases `summarise-children-of-finished-parents`,
  `summarise-unknown-parents-still-count`.
- **QA-AS14-2.** `canRemoveCheckpoint` (new). Deleting an unreleased
  hold point cleared `canClosePlan` without anyone verifying, waiving or
  setting it aside, and left no trace. A finished plan keeps its points,
  a point with a result recorded is evidence, and a hold point outside
  Draft is released as Not applicable (who, when, why), never deleted.
  Cases `remove-*`.
- **QA-AS14-3.** `canRaiseNcr` (new). An NCR could be raised against a
  closed plan. No plan is allowed; a finished plan is not. Cases
  `raise-ncr-*`.

Negative control: the previous engine fails every `repaired` case above
(the two new functions do not exist in it).
