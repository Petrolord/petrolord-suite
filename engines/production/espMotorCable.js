/**
 * ESP motor, cable and surface power (Production P5).
 *
 * The electrical half of an installation. Three questions:
 *
 *   what current does the motor draw at this load
 *   what does the cable lose carrying it down the hole
 *   what has to be present at surface for the motor to see its plate
 *
 * Cable resistance is the published copper conductor data (ohms per
 * 1000 ft at 77 degF, from the standard AWG tables) with the usual
 * temperature correction alpha = 0.00393 per degF referenced to 77
 * degF, applied at the average cable temperature. Nothing here is a
 * vendor table: conductor resistance is a property of copper, and
 * ampacity limits belong to the cable's insulation system and must come
 * from the manufacturer, which is why they are inputs with the
 * published copper values only as a default.
 *
 * The three-phase voltage drop is the standard
 *
 *   dV = sqrt(3) * I * R_total * (cable length in thousands of feet)
 *
 * with R in ohms per 1000 ft. Power factor enters the kVA, not the
 * resistive drop.
 *
 * Field units: length ft, temperature degF, current A, voltage V,
 * power hp and kW.
